.Steps

. From the cluster that has the FlexCache volume, take the FlexCache volume offline:
+
`volume offline -vserver svm_name -volume volume_name`
. Delete the FlexCache volume:
+
`volume flexcache delete -vserver svm_name -volume volume_name`
+
The FlexCache relationship details are removed from the origin volume and the FlexCache volume.
