= Supported and unsupported features for ONTAP FlexCache volumes
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.5, you can configure FlexCache volumes.  FlexVol volumes are supported as origin volumes and FlexGroup volumes are supported as FlexCache volumes. Beginning with ONTAP 9.7 both FlexVol volumes and FlexGroup volumes are supported as origin volumes. The supported features and protocols for the origin volume and the FlexCache volume vary. 

[NOTE]
Cache volumes and origin volumes can interoperate as long as both are running on a supported version of ONTAP. Keep in mind that features are supported only when both the cache and the origin are running at least the ONTAP version where support was introduced or a later ONTAP version.

== ONTAP version support between FlexCache volumes and origin volumes

The recommended ONTAP version supported between origin volume and the cache volume is no more than four versions earlier or four versions later.  For example, if the cache is using ONTAP 9.14.1, the earliest version the origin can be using is ONTAP 9.10.1.

== Supported protocols

|===

h| Protocol h| Supported at the origin volume? h| Supported at the FlexCache volume?


a|
NFSv3
a|
Yes
a|
Yes

a|
NFSv4
a|
Yes

To access cache volumes using NFSv4.x protocol, both the origin and cache clusters must be using ONTAP 9.10.1 or later. The origin cluster and FlexCache cluster can have different ONTAP versions, but both should be ONTAP 9.10.1 and later versions, for example, the origin can have ONTAP 9.10.1, and the cache can have ONTAP  9.11.1.
a|
Yes

Supported beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1.

h| Feature h| Supported at the origin volume? h| Supported at the FlexCache volume?

a|
Autonomous ransomware protection
a|
Yes

Supported for FlexVol origin volumes beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, and supported for FlexGroup origin volumes beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1. See link:../anti-ransomware/use-cases-restrictions-concept.html#unsupported-configurations[Autonomous Ransomware Protection use cases and considerations].

a|
No
a|
Antivirus
a|
Yes

Supported beginning with ONTAP 9.7.

a|
Not applicable

If you configure antivirus scanning at the origin, it is not required on the cache. The origin antivirus scanning detects files infected with viruses before writes are committed, regardless of the write source. For more information about using antivirus scanning with FlexCache, see the https://www.netapp.com/media/7336-tr4743.pdf[FlexCache with ONTAP technical report^].

a|
Auditing
a|
Yes

Supported beginning with ONTAP 9.7.
You can audit NFS file access events in FlexCache relationships using native ONTAP auditing.
For more information, see xref:audit-flexcache-volumes-concept.adoc[Considerations for auditing FlexCache volumes]

a|
Yes

Supported beginning with ONTAP 9.7.
You can audit NFS file access events in FlexCache relationships using native ONTAP auditing.

[NOTE]
In ONTAP 9 releases earlier than 9.5, origin FlexVol volumes can only serve data to FlexCache volumes created on systems running Data ONTAP 8.2.x operating in 7-Mode. Beginning with ONTAP 9.5, origin FlexVol volumes can also serve data to FlexCache volumes on ONTAP 9 systems. For information about migrating from 7-Mode FlexCache to ONTAP 9 FlexCache see link:https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/7336-tr4743pdf.pdf[NetApp Technical Report 4743: FlexCache in ONTAP^].
