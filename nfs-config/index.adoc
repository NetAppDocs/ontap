You can use ONTAP 9 CLI commands to configure NFS client access to files contained in a new volume or qtree in a new or existing storage virtual machine (SVM).

Use these procedures if you want to configure access to a volume or qtree in the following way:

* You want to use any version of NFS currently supported by ONTAP: NFSv3, NFSv4, NFSv4.1, NFSv4.2, or NFSv4.1 with pNFS.
* You want to use the command-line interface (CLI), not System Manager or an automated scripting tool.
+
To use System Manager to configure NAS multiprotocol access, see link:../task_nas_provision_nfs_and_smb.html[Provision NAS storage for both Windows and Linux using both NFS and SMB].

* You want to use best practices, not explore every available option.
+
Learn more about command syntax in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/[ONTAP command reference^].

* UNIX file permissions will be used to secure the new volume.
* You have cluster administrator privileges, not SVM administrator privileges.

If you want details about the range of ONTAP NFS protocol capabilities, consult the link:../nfs-admin/index.html[NFS reference overview].
