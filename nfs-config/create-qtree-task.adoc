[.lead]
You can create a qtree to contain your data and specify its properties by using the `volume qtree create` command.

.Before you begin

* The SVM and the volume that will contain the new qtree must already exist.
* The SVM security style must be UNIX, and NFS should be set up and running.

.Steps

. Create the qtree:
+
`volume qtree create -vserver _vserver_name_ { -volume _volume_name_ -qtree _qtree_name_ | -qtree-path _qtree path_ } -security-style unix [-policy _export_policy_name_]`
+
You can specify the volume and qtree as separate arguments or specify the qtree path argument in the format `/vol/_volume_name/_qtree_name_`.
+
By default, qtrees inherit the export policies of their parent volume, but they can be configured to use their own. If you plan to use an existing export policy, you can specify it when you create the qtree. You can also add an export policy later with the `volume qtree modify` command.

. Verify that the qtree was created with the desired junction path:
+
`volume qtree show -vserver _vserver_name_ { -volume _volume_name_ -qtree _qtree_name_ | -qtree-path _qtree path_ }`

.Example

The following example creates a qtree named qt01 located on SVM vs1.example.com that has a junction path `/vol/data1`:

----
cluster1::> volume qtree create -vserver vs1.example.com -qtree-path /vol/data1/qt01 -security-style unix
[Job 1642] Job succeeded: Successful

cluster1::> volume qtree show -vserver vs1.example.com -qtree-path /vol/data1/qt01

                      Vserver Name: vs1.example.com
                       Volume Name: data1
                        Qtree Name: qt01
  Actual (Non-Junction) Qtree Path: /vol/data1/qt01
                    Security Style: unix
                       Oplock Mode: enable
                  Unix Permissions: ---rwxr-xr-x
                          Qtree Id: 2
                      Qtree Status: normal
                     Export Policy: default
        Is Export Policy Inherited: true
