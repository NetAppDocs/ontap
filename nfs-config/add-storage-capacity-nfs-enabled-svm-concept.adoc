To add storage capacity to an NFS-enabled SVM, you must create a volume or qtree to provide a storage container, and create or modify an export policy for that container. You can then verify NFS client access from the cluster and test access from client systems.

.Before you begin

* NFS must be completely set up on the SVM.
* The default export policy of the SVM root volume must contain a rule that permits access to all clients.
* Any updates to your name services configuration must be complete.
* Any additions or modifications to a Kerberos configuration must be complete.
