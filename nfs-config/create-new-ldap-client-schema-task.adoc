If the LDAP schema in your environment differs from the ONTAP defaults, you must create a new LDAP client schema for ONTAP before creating the LDAP client configuration.

.About this task

Most LDAP servers can use the default schemas provided by ONTAP:

* MS-AD-BIS (the preferred schema for most Windows 2012 and later AD servers)
* AD-IDMU (Windows 2008, Windows 2012 and later AD servers)
* AD-SFU (Windows 2003 and earlier AD servers)
* RFC-2307 (UNIX LDAP servers)

If you need to use a non-default LDAP schema, you must create it before creating the LDAP client configuration. Consult with your LDAP administrator before creating a new schema.

The default LDAP schemas provided by ONTAP cannot be modified. To create a new schema, you create a copy and then modify the copy accordingly.

.Steps

. Display the existing LDAP client schema templates to identify the one you want to copy:
+
`vserver services name-service ldap client schema show`
. Set the privilege level to advanced:
+
`set -privilege advanced`
. Make a copy of an existing LDAP client schema:
+
`vserver services name-service ldap client schema copy -vserver _vserver_name_ -schema _existing_schema_name_ -new-schema-name _new_schema_name_`
. Modify the new schema and customize it for your environment:
+
`vserver services name-service ldap client schema modify`
. Return to the admin privilege level:
+
`set -privilege admin`
