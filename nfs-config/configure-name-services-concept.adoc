Depending on the configuration of your storage system, ONTAP needs to be able to look up host, user, group, or netgroup information to provide proper access to clients. You must configure name services to enable ONTAP to access local or external name services to obtain this information.

You should use a name service such as NIS or LDAP to facilitate name lookups during client authentication. It is best to use LDAP whenever possible for greater security, especially when deploying NFSv4 or later. You should also configure local users and groups in case external name servers are not available.

Name service information must be kept synchronized on all sources.
