If you are unfamiliar with how ONTAP implements NFS exports, you can compare 7-Mode and ONTAP export configuration tools, as well as sample 7-Mode `/etc/exports` files with clustered policies and rules.

In ONTAP there is no `/etc/exports` file and no `exportfs` command. Instead, you must define an export policy. Export policies enable you to control client access in much the same way as you did in 7-Mode, but give you additional functionality such as the ability to reuse the same export policy for multiple volumes.
