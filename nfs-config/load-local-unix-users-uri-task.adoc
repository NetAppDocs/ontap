As an alternative to manually creating individual local UNIX users in SVMs, you can simplify the task by loading a list of local UNIX users into SVMs from a uniform resource identifier (URI) (`vserver services name-service unix-user load-from-uri`).

.Steps

. Create a file containing the list of local UNIX users you want to load.
+
The file must contain user information in the UNIX `/etc/passwd` format:
+
`_user_name: password: user_ID: group_ID: full_name_`
+
The command discards the value of the `_password_` field and the values of the fields after the `_full_name_` field (`_home_directory_` and `_shell_`).
+
The maximum supported file size is 2.5 MB.

. Verify that the list does not contain any duplicate information.
+
If the list contains duplicate entries, loading the list fails with an error message.

. Copy the file to a server.
+
The server must be reachable by the storage system over HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, or FTPS.

. Determine what the URI for the file is.
+
The URI is the address you provide to the storage system to indicate where the file is located.

. Load the file containing the list of local UNIX users into SVMs from the URI:
+
`vserver services name-service unix-user load-from-uri -vserver _vserver_name_ -uri {ftp|http|ftps|https}://_uri_ -overwrite {true|false}`
+
`-overwrite` {`true`|`false`} specifies whether to overwrite entries. The default is `false`.

.Example

The following command loads a list of local UNIX users from the URI `+ftp://ftp.example.com/passwd+` into the SVM named vs1. Existing users on the SVM are not overwritten by information from the URI.

node::> vserver services name-service unix-user load-from-uri -vserver vs1
-uri ftp://ftp.example.com/passwd -overwrite false
