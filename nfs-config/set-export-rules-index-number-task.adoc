You can use the `vserver export-policy rule setindex` command to manually set an existing export rule's index number. This enables you to specify the precedence by which ONTAP applies export rules to client requests.

.About this task

If the new index number is already in use, the command inserts the rule at the specified spot and reorders the list accordingly.

.Step

. Modify the index number of a specified export rule:
+
`vserver export-policy rule setindex -vserver _virtual_server_name_ -policyname _policy_name_ -ruleindex _integer_ -newruleindex _integer_`

.Example

The following command changes the index number of an export rule at index number 3 to index number 2 in an export policy named rs1 on the SVM named vs1:

----
vs1::> vserver export-policy rule setindex -vserver vs1
-policyname rs1 -ruleindex 3 -newruleindex 2
