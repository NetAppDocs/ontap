[.lead]
The NFS configuration worksheet enables you to collect the required information to set up NFS access for clients.

You should complete one or both sections of the worksheet depending on the decision you made about where to provision storage:

If you are configuring NFS access to an SVM, you should complete both sections.

* Configuring NFS access to an SVM
* Adding storage capacity to an NFS-enabled SVM

If you are adding storage capacity to an NFS-enabled SVM, you should complete only:
