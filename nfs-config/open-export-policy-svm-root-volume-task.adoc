The default export policy of the SVM root volume must include a rule to allow all clients open access through NFS. Without such a rule, all NFS clients are denied access to the SVM and its volumes.

.About this task

When a new SVM is created, a default export policy (called default) is created automatically for the root volume of the SVM. You must create one or more rules for the default export policy before clients can access data on the SVM.

You should verify that access is open to all NFS clients in the default export policy, and later restrict access to individual volumes by creating custom export policies for individual volumes or qtrees.

.Steps

. If you are using an existing SVM, check the default root volume export policy:
+
`vserver export-policy rule show`
+
The command output should be similar to the following:
+
----

cluster::> vserver export-policy rule show -vserver vs1.example.com -policyname default -instance

                                    Vserver: vs1.example.com
                                Policy Name: default
                                 Rule Index: 1
                            Access Protocol:  nfs
Client Match Hostname, IP Address, Netgroup, or Domain: 0.0.0.0/0
                             RO Access Rule: any
                             RW Access Rule: any
User ID To Which Anonymous Users Are Mapped: 65534
                   Superuser Security Types: any
               Honor SetUID Bits in SETATTR: true
                  Allow Creation of Devices: true
----
+
If such a rule exists that allows open access, this task is complete. If not, proceed to the next step.

. Create an export rule for the SVM root volume:
+
`vserver export-policy rule create -vserver _vserver_name_ -policyname default -ruleindex 1 -protocol nfs -clientmatch 0.0.0.0/0 -rorule any â€‘rwrule any -superuser any`
+
If the SVM will only contain volumes secured by Kerberos, you can set the export rule options `-rorule`, `-rwrule`, and `-superuser` for the root volume to `krb5` or `krb5i`. For example:
+
`-rorule krb5i -rwrule krb5i -superuser krb5i`

. Verify rule creation by using the `vserver export-policy rule show` command.

.Result

Any NFS client can now access any volume or qtree created on the SVM.
