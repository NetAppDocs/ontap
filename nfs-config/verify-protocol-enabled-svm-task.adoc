[.lead]
Before you can configure and use NFS on SVMs, you must verify that the protocol is enabled.

.About this task

This is typically done during SVM setup, but if you did not enable the protocol during setup, you can enable it later by using the `vserver add-protocols` command.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot add or remove a protocol from a LIF once it is created.
====

You can also disable protocols on SVMs using the `vserver remove-protocols` command.

.Steps

. Check which protocols are currently enabled and disabled for the SVM:
+
`vserver show -vserver _vserver_name_ -protocols`
+
You can also use the `vserver show-protocols` command to view the currently enabled protocols on all SVMs in the cluster.

. If necessary, enable or disable a protocol:
 ** To enable the NFS protocol:
 +
`vserver add-protocols -vserver _vserver_name_ -protocols nfs`
 ** To disable a protocol:
 +
`vserver remove-protocols -vserver    _vserver_name_ -protocols _protocol_name_[,_protocol_name_,...]`
. Confirm that the enabled and disabled protocols were updated correctly:
+
`vserver show -vserver _vserver_name_ -protocols`

.Example

The following command displays which protocols are currently enabled and disabled (allowed and disallowed) on the SVM named vs1:

----
vs1::> vserver show -vserver vs1.example.com -protocols
Vserver           Allowed Protocols         Disallowed Protocols
-----------       ----------------------    -----------------------
vs1.example.com   nfs                       cifs, fcp, iscsi, ndmp
----

The following command allows access over NFS by adding `nfs` to the list of enabled protocols on the SVM named vs1:

----
vs1::> vserver add-protocols -vserver vs1.example.com -protocols nfs
