As an alternative to manually creating individual local UNIX groups, you can load a list of local UNIX groups into SVMs from a uniform resource identifier (URI) by using the `vserver services name-service unix-group load-from-uri` command.

.Steps

. Create a file containing the list of local UNIX groups you want to load.
+
The file must contain group information in the UNIX `/etc/group` format:
+
`_group_name: password: group_ID: comma_separated_list_of_users_`
+
The command discards the value of the `_password_` field.
+
The maximum supported file size is 1 MB.
+
The maximum length of each line in the group file is 32,768 characters.

. Verify that the list does not contain any duplicate information.
+
The list must not contain duplicate entries, or else loading the list fails. If there are entries already present in the SVM, you must either set the `-overwrite` parameter to `true` to overwrite all existing entries with the new file, or ensure that the new file does not contain any entries that duplicate existing entries.

. Copy the file to a server.
+
The server must be reachable by the storage system over HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, or FTPS.

. Determine what the URI for the file is.
+
The URI is the address you provide to the storage system to indicate where the file is located.

. Load the file containing the list of local UNIX groups into the SVM from the URI:
+
`vserver services name-service unix-group load-from-uri -vserver _vserver_name_ -uri {ftp|http|ftps|https}://_uri_ -overwrite {true|false}`
+
`-overwrite` {`true`|`false`} specifies whether to overwrite entries. The default is `false`. If you specify this parameter as `true`, ONTAP replaces the entire existing local UNIX group database of the specified SVM with the entries from the file you are loading.

.Example

The following command loads a list of local UNIX groups from the URI `+ftp://ftp.example.com/group+` into the SVM named vs1. Existing groups on the SVM are not overwritten by information from the URI.

----
vs1::> vserver services name-service unix-group load-from-uri -vserver vs1
-uri ftp://ftp.example.com/group -overwrite false
