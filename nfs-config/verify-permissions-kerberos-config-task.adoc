Kerberos requires that certain UNIX permissions be set for the SVM root volume and for local users and groups.

.Steps

. Display the relevant permissions on the SVM root volume:
+
`volume show -volume _root_vol_name_-fields user,group,unix-permissions`
+
The root volume of the SVM must have the following configuration:
+
[options="header"]
|===
| Name...| Setting...
a|
UID
a|
root or ID 0
a|
GID
a|
root or ID 0
a|
UNIX permissions
a|
755
|===
If these values are not shown, use the `volume modify` command to update them.

. Display the local UNIX users:
+
`vserver services name-service unix-user show -vserver _vserver_name_`
+
The SVM must have the following UNIX users configured:
+
[options="header"]
|===
| User name| User ID| Primary group ID| Comment
a|
nfs
a|
500
a|
0
a|
Required for GSS INIT phase.

The first component of the NFS client user SPN is used as the user.

The nfs user is not required if a Kerberos-UNIX name mapping exists for the SPN of the NFS client user.
a|
root
a|
0
a|
0
a|
Required for mounting.
|===
If these values are not shown, you can use the `vserver services name-service unix-user modify` command to update them.

. Display the local UNIX groups:
+
`vserver services name-service unix-group show -vserver _vserver_ _name`
+
The SVM must have the following UNIX groups configured:
+
[options="header"]
|===
| Group name| Group ID
a|
daemon
a|
1
a|
root
a|
0
|===
If these values are not shown, you can use the `vserver services name-service unix-group modify` command to update them.
