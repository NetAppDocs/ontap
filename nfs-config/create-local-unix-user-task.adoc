You can use the `vserver services name-service unix-user create` command to create local UNIX users. A local UNIX user is a UNIX user you create on the SVM as a UNIX name services option to be used in the processing of name mappings.

.Step

. Create a local UNIX user:
+
`vserver services name-service unix-user create -vserver _vserver_name_ -user _user_name_ -id _integer_ -primary-gid _integer_ -full-name _full_name_`
+
`-user _user_name_` specifies the user name. The length of the user name must be 64 characters or fewer.
+
`-id _integer_` specifies the user ID that you assign.
+
`-primary-gid _integer_` specifies the primary group ID. This adds the user to the primary group. After creating the user, you can manually add the user to any desired additional group.

.Example

The following command creates a local UNIX user named johnm (full name "John Miller") on the SVM named vs1. The user has the ID 123 and the primary group ID 100.

node::> vserver services name-service unix-user create -vserver vs1 -user johnm -id 123
-primary-gid 100 -full-name "John Miller"
