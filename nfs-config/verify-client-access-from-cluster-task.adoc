You can give select clients access to the share by setting UNIX file permissions on a UNIX administration host. You can check client access by using the `vserver export-policy check-access` command, adjusting the export rules as necessary.

.Steps

. On the cluster, check client access to exports by using the `vserver export-policy check-access` command.
+
The following command checks read/write access for an NFSv3 client with the IP address 1.2.3.4 to the volume home2. The command output shows that the volume uses the export policy `exp-home-dir` and that access is denied.

. Examine the output to determine whether the export policy works as intended and the client access behaves as expected.
+
Specifically, you should verify which export policy is used by the volume or qtree and the type of access the client has as a result.

. If necessary, reconfigure the export policy rules.
