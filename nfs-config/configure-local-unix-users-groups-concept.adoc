You can use local UNIX users and groups on the SVM for authentication and name mappings. You can create UNIX users and groups manually, or you can load a file containing UNIX users or groups from a uniform resource identifier (URI).

There is a default maximum limit of 32,768 local UNIX user groups and group members combined in the cluster. The cluster administrator can modify this limit.
