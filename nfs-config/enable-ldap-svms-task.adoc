To enable LDAP on an SVM, you must use the `vserver services name-service ldap create` command to associate an LDAP client configuration with the SVM.

.Before you begin

* An LDAP domain must already exist within the network and must be accessible to the cluster that the SVM is located on.
* An LDAP client configuration must exist on the SVM.

.Steps

. Enable LDAP on the SVM:
+
`vserver services name-service ldap create -vserver _vserver_name_ -client-config _client_config_name_`
+
[NOTE]
====
Beginning with ONTAP 9.2, the `vserver services name-service ldap create` command performs an automatic configuration validation and reports an error message if ONTAP is unable to contact the name server.
====
+
The following command enables LDAP on the "vs1"SVM and configures it to use the "ldap1" LDAP client configuration:
+
----
cluster1::> vserver services name-service ldap create -vserver vs1 -client-config ldap1 -client-enabled true
----

. Validate the status of the name servers by using the vserver services name-service ldap check command.
+
The following command validates LDAP servers on the SVM vs1.
+
----
cluster1::> vserver services name-service ldap check -vserver vs1

| Vserver: vs1                                                |
| Client Configuration Name: c1                               |
| LDAP Status: up                                             |
| LDAP Status Details: Successfully connected to LDAP server "10.11.12.13".                                              |

The name service check command is available beginning with ONTAP 9.2.
