Before provisioning NFS storage for clients, you must ensure that there is sufficient space in an existing aggregate for the new volume. If there is not, you can add disks to an existing aggregate or create a new aggregate of the desired type.

.Steps

. Display available space in existing aggregates:
+
`storage aggregate show`
+
If there is an aggregate with sufficient space, record its name in the worksheet.

. If there are no aggregates with sufficient space, add disks to an existing aggregate by using the `storage aggregate add-disks` command, or create a new aggregate by using the `storage aggregate create` command.
