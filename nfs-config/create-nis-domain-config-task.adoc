If a Network Information Service (NIS) is used in your environment for name services, you must create an NIS domain configuration for the SVM by using the `vserver services name-service nis-domain create` command.

.Before you begin

All configured NIS servers must be available and reachable before you configure the NIS domain on the SVM.

If you plan to use NIS for directory searches, the maps in your NIS servers cannot have more than 1,024 characters for each entry. Do not specify the NIS server that does not comply with this limit. Otherwise, client access dependent on NIS entries might fail.

.About this task

If your NIS database contains a `netgroup.byhost` map, ONTAP can use it for quicker searches. The `netgroup.byhost` and `netgroup` maps in the directory must be kept in sync at all times to avoid client access issues. Beginning with ONTAP 9.7, NIS `netgroup.byhost` entries can be cached using the `vserver services name-service nis-domain netgroup-database` commands.

Using NIS for host name resolution is not supported.

.Steps

. Create an NIS domain configuration:
+
`vserver services name-service nis-domain create -vserver vs1 -domain <domain_name> -nis-servers <IP_addresses>`
+
You can specify up to 10 NIS servers.
+
[NOTE]
====
Beginning with ONTAP 9.2, the field `-nis-servers` replaces the field `-servers`. This new field can take either a hostname or an IP address for the NIS server.
====

. Verify that the domain is created:
+
`vserver services name-service nis-domain show`

.Example

The following command creates an NIS domain configuration for an NIS domain called `nisdomain` on the SVM named `vs1` with an NIS server at IP address `192.0.2.180`:

----
vs1::> vserver services name-service nis-domain create -vserver vs1 -domain nisdomain -nis-servers 192.0.2.180
