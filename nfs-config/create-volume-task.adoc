You can create a volume and specify its junction point and other properties by using the `volume create` command.

.About this task

A volume must include a _junction path_ for its data to be made available to clients. You can specify the junction path when you create a new volume. If you create a volume without specifying a junction path, you must _mount_ the volume in the SVM namespace using the `volume mount` command.

.Before you begin

* NFS should be set up and running.
* The SVM security style must be UNIX.

.Steps

. Create the volume with a junction point:
+
`volume create -vserver _svm_name_ -volume _volume_name_ -aggregate _aggregate_name_ -size {_integer_[KB|MB|GB|TB|PB]} -security-style unix -user _user_name_or_number_ -group _group_name_or_number_ -junction-path _junction_path_ [-policy _export_policy_name_]`
+
The choices for `-junction-path` are the following:

** Directly under root, for example, `/_new_vol_`
+
You can create a new volume and specify that it be mounted directly to the SVM root volume.

** Under an existing directory, for example, `/_existing_dir/new_vol_`
+
You can create a new volume and specify that it be mounted to an existing volume (in an existing hierarchy), expressed as a directory.

+
If you want to create a volume in a new directory (in a new hierarchy under a new volume), for example, `_/new_dir/new_vol_`, then you must first create a new parent volume that is junctioned to the SVM root volume. You would then create the new child volume in the junction path of the new parent volume (new directory).
+
If you plan to use an existing export policy, you can specify it when you create the volume. You can also add an export policy later with the `volume modify` command.

. Verify that the volume was created with the desired junction point:
+
`volume show -vserver _svm_name_ -volume _volume_name_ -junction`

.Examples

The following command creates a new volume named users1 on the SVM vs1.example.com and the aggregate aggr1. The new volume is made available at `/users`. The volume is 750 GB in size, and its volume guarantee is of type volume (by default).

----
cluster1::> volume create -vserver vs1.example.com -volume users -aggregate aggr1 -size 750g -junction-path /users
[Job 1642] Job succeeded: Successful

cluster1::> volume show -vserver vs1.example.com -volume users -junction
                          Junction                 Junction
Vserver           Volume  Active   Junction Path   Path Source
----------------- ------- -------- --------------- -----------
vs1.example.com   users1  true     /users          RW_volume
----

The following command creates a new volume named "home4" on the SVM "vs1.example.com" and the aggregate "aggr1". The directory `/eng/` already exists in the namespace for the vs1 SVM, and the new volume is made available at `/eng/home`, which becomes the home directory for the `/eng/` namespace. The volume is 750 GB in size, and its volume guarantee is of type `volume` (by default).

----
cluster1::> volume create -vserver vs1.example.com -volume home4 -aggregate aggr1 -size 750g -junction-path /eng/home
[Job 1642] Job succeeded: Successful

cluster1::> volume show -vserver vs1.example.com -volume home4 -junction
                         Junction                 Junction
Vserver          Volume  Active   Junction Path   Path Source
---------------- ------- -------- --------------- -----------
vs1.example.com  home4   true     /eng/home       RW_volume
