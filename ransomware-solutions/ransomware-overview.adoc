Ransomware remains one of the most significant threats causing business interruption for organization in 2024. According to the https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2024/04/30/the-state-of-ransomware-2024/[Sophos State of Ransomware 2024^], ransomware attacks affected 72% of their surveyed audience. Ransomware attacks have evolved to be more sophisticated and targeted, with threat actors employing advanced techniques like artificial intelligence to maximize their impact and profits. 

Organizations must look across their entire security posture from perimeter, network, identity, application, and where the data lives at the storage level and secure these layers. Adopting a data-centric approach to cyber protection at the storage layer is crucial in today's threat landscape. Although no single solution can thwart all attacks, using a portfolio of solutions, including partnerships and third parties, provides a layered defense.

The <<NetApp's ransomware protection portfolio,NetApp product portfolio>> provides various effective tools for visibility, detection, and remediation, helping you to spot ransomware early, prevent spread, and recover quickly, if necessary, to avoid costly downtime. Traditional layered defense solutions remain prevalent, as do third parties and partner solutions for visibility and detection. Effective remediation remains a crucial part of the response to any threat. The unique industry approach leveraging immutable NetApp Snapshot technology and SnapLock logical air gap solution is an industry differentiator and the industry best practice for ransomware remediation capabilities.

NOTE: Beginning in July 2024, content from the technical report _TR-4572: NetApp Ransomware Protection_, which was previously published as a PDF, has been integrated with the rest of the ONTAP product documentation. 

== Data is the primary target
Cybercriminals increasingly target data directly, recognizing its value. While perimeter, network, and application security are important, they can be bypassed. Focusing on protecting data at its source, the storage layer, provides a critical last line of defense. Gaining access to production data and encrypting or rendering it inaccessible is the objective of ransomware attacks. To get there, attackers must have already pierced existing defenses deployed by organizations today, from perimeter to application security.

Unfortunately, many organizations don't take advantage of security capabilities at the data layer. This is where NetApp ransomware protection portfolio comes in, protecting you at the last line of defense.

== The real cost of ransomware
The ransom payment itself is not the largest monetary effect on a business. Although the payment is not insignificant, it pales in comparison to the downtime cost of suffering a ransomware incident.

Ransom payments are just one element of recovery costs when dealing with ransomware events. Excluding any ransoms paid, in 2024 organizations reported a mean cost to recover from a ransomware attack of $2.73M, an increase of almost $1M from the $1.82M reported in 2023 according to the https://assets.sophos.com/X24WTUEQ/at/9brgj5n44hqvgsp5f5bqcps/sophos-state-of-ransomware-2024-wp.pdf[2024 Sophos State of Ransomware^] report. For organizations that rely heavily on IT availability, such as e-commerce, equities trading, and health care, costs can be 10 times higher or more.

Cyber insurance costs also continue to rise given the very real likelihood of a ransomware attack on insured companies.

== Ransomware protection at the data layer

NetApp understands your security posture is wide and deep across your organization from the perimeter to the where your data lives at the storage layer. Your security stack is complex and should provide security at every level of your technology stack.

Real-time protection at the data layer is even more important and has unique requirements. To be effective, solutions at this layer must offer these critical attributes:

* *Security by design* to minimize chance of successful attack
* *Real-time detection and response* to minimize impact of a successful attack
* *Air-gapped WORM protection* to isolate critical data backups
* *A single control plane* for comprehensive ransomware defense

NetApp can deliver all of this and more.

== NetApp's ransomware protection portfolio

NetApp's link:../ransomware-solutions/ransomware-protection.html[built-in ransomware protection] delivers real-time, robust, multi-faceted defense for your critical data. At its core, advanced AI-powered detection algorithms continuously monitor data patterns, swiftly identifying potential ransomware threats with 99% accuracy. Reacting quickly to attacks allows our storage to quickly snapshot data and secure the copies ensuring rapid recovery.

To further fortify data, NetApp's link:../ransomware-solutions/ransomware-cyber-vaulting.html[cyber vaulting] capability isolates data with a logical air gap. By safeguarding critical data, we ensure rapid business continuity.

NetApp link:../ransomware-solutions/ransomware-bluexp-protection.html[BlueXP ransomware protection] reduces operational burdens with a single control plane to intelligently coordinate and execute an end-to-end workload-centric ransomware defense, so you can identify and protect critical workload data at risk with a single click, accurately and automatically detect and respond to limit the impact of a potential attack, and recover workloads within minutes, not days, safeguarding your valuable workload data and minimizing costly disruption.

As a native, built-in ONTAP solution for protecting unauthorized access to your data, link:../multi-admin-verify/index.html[multi-admin verification (MAV)] has a robust set of capabilities that ensure that operations such as deleting volumes, creating additional administrative users, or deleting snapshots can be executed only after approvals from at least a second designated administrator. This prevents compromised, malicious, or inexperienced administrators from making undesirable changes or deleting data. You can configure as many designated administrator approvers as you want before a snapshot can be deleted.

NOTE: NetApp ONTAP addresses the requirement for web-based https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/17055-tr4647pdf.pdf[multi-factor authentication (MFA)^] in System Manager and for SSH CLI authentication.

NetApp's ransomware protection offers peace of mind in an ever-evolving threat landscape. Its comprehensive approach not only defends against current ransomware variants but also adapts to emerging threats, providing long-term security for your data infrastructure.
