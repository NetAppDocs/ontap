Beginning with ONTAP 9.3, you can expand the source FlexGroup volume of a SnapMirror relationship by adding new constituents to the source volume. You can expand the source volume in the same way that you expand a regular FlexGroup volume (read-write volume).

.Steps

. Expand the source FlexGroup volume: `+volume expand -vserver vserver_name -volume fg_src -aggr-list aggregate name,... [-aggr-list-multiplier constituents_per_aggr]+`
+
----
cluster1::> volume expand -volume src_fg -aggr-list aggr1 -aggr-list-multiplier 2 -vserver vs_src

Warning: The following number of constituents of size 50GB will be added to FlexGroup "src_fg": 2.
Expanding the FlexGroup will cause the state of all snapshots to be set to "partial".
Partial snapshots cannot be restored.
