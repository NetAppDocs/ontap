.About this task

Client access to the destination FlexGroup volume is blocked for a brief period when some SnapMirror operations, such as SnapMirror break and resynchronization, are running. If the SnapMirror operation fails, it is possible that some of the constituents remain in this state and access to the FlexGroup volume is denied. In such cases, you must retry the SnapMirror operation.
