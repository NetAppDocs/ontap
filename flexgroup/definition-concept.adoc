A FlexGroup volume is a scale-out NAS container that provides high performance along with automatic load distribution and scalability. A FlexGroup volume contains several member volumes (constituents) that automatically and transparently share the traffic. _Member volumes_ are the underlying FlexVol volumes that make up a FlexGroup volume.

FlexGroup volumes provide the following benefits:

* High scalability
+
Multiple FlexGroup volumes can be provisioned on a cluster as long as the number of member volumes does not exceed the node or cluster limits.
+
Beginning in ONTAP 9.12.1P2, the maximum capacity for a single FlexGroup volume is 60PB, with 400 billion files on a 10-node cluster when link:../volumes/enable-large-vol-file-support-task.html[large volume support is enabled]. Without large volume support, the maximum capacity for a single FlexGroup volume is 20PB. 

[NOTE]
====
Although the maximum capacity of a single FlexGroup volume is 60PB (200 member volumes x 300TB = 60PB), best performance is achieved when the used capacity of member volumes remains below 80% (200 member volumes x 240TB = 48PB).     
====

* High performance
+
FlexGroup volumes can utilize the resources of the cluster to serve workloads that have high throughput and low latency.

* Simplified management
+
A FlexGroup volume is a single namespace container that can be managed in a similar way as FlexVol volumes.
