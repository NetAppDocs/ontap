[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, storage administrators can grant rights on a volume to allow NFS and SMB clients to perform asynchronous delete operations. When asynchronous delete is enabled on the cluster, Linux client users can use the `mv` command and Windows client users can use the `rename` command to delete a directory on the specified volume by moving it to a hidden directory that by default is named .ontaptrashbin. 

Rights are granted per volume. NFS client users should have root access on the NFS client and superuser access to the NFS export. 

You can move directories only. You cannot move files to the .ontaptrashbin directory.

== Enable client asynchronous directory delete

.Steps

. From the cluster CLI, enter advanced privilege mode: `-privilege advance`

. Enable client asynchronous delete at the mountpoint of a volume and, if desired, provide an alternate name for the trashbin directory:
+
`volume file async-delete client enable volume _volname_ vserver _vserverName_ trashbinname _name_`
+
Example using the default trashbin name:
+
----
cluster1::*> volume file async-delete client enable -volume v1 -vserver  vs0

Info: Async directory delete from the client has been enabled on volume "v1" in
      Vserver "vs0".
----
+
Example specifying an alternate trashbin name:
+
----
cluster1::*> volume file async-delete client enable -volume test -trashbin .ntaptrash -vserver vs1

Success: Async directory delete from the client is enabled on volume "v1" in
      Vserver "vs0".
----

. Verify client asynchronous delete is enabled:
+
`volume file async-delete client show`
+
Example:
+
----
cluster1::*> volume file async-delete client show

Vserver Volume      async-delete client TrashBinName
------------ ------------ ----------------------- -------------
vs1          vol1         Enabled          .ntaptrash
vs2          vol2         Disabled          -

== Disable client asynchronous directory delete

.Steps

. From the cluster CLI, disable client asychronous directory delete:
+
`volume file async-delete client disable volume _volname_ vserver _vserverName_`
+
Example:
+
----
cluster1::*> volume file async-delete client disable -volume vol1 -vserver vs1

       Success: Asynchronous directory delete client disabled successfully on volume.
----
. Verify client asynchronous delete is disabled:
+
`volume file async-delete client show`
+
Example:
+
----
cluster1::*> volume file async-delete client show

Vserver      Volume      async-delete client      TrashBinName
------------ ------------ ----------------------- -------------
vs1          vol1         Disabled                -
vs2          vol2         Disabled                -
