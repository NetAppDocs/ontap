You should be aware of the ONTAP features that are supported and not supported with FlexGroup volumes in ONTAP 9.

== Features supported beginning with ONTAP 9.16.1

*  xref:enable-adv-capacity-flexgroup-task.html[Advanced capacity balancing]

== Features supported beginning with ONTAP 9.15.1

* xref:provision-automatically-task.html[Automatic provisioning enhancements]

== Features supported beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1

* Snapshot tagging: Support for creating, modifying and deleting snapshot tags (SnapMirror labels and comments) for snapshots on FlexGroup volumes using the `volume snapshot` command.

== Features supported beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1

* xref:../anti-ransomware/index.html[Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP)] for FlexGroup volumes, including the following supported functionality:
** FlexGroup expand operations: A new member volume inherits Autonomous Ransomware Protection attributes.
** FlexVol to FlexGroup conversions: Conversions of FlexVols with active Autonomous Ransomware Protection is possible.
** FlexGroup rebalancing: Autonomous Ransomware Protection is supported during disruptive and non-disruptive rebalancing operations.
* Schedule a single FlexGroup rebalancing operation.
* xref:create-snapmirror-cascade-fanout-reference.html[SnapMirror fanout] relationships with SVM DR on FlexGroup volumes. Supports fanout to eight sites.

== Features supported beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1

* xref:manage-flexgroup-rebalance-task.html[FlexGroup rebalancing]
* SnapLock for SnapVault
* xref:../data-protection/cloud-backup-with-snapmirror-task.html[SnapMirror Cloud]
* FabricPool, FlexGroup, and SVM DR working in conjunction. (In releases earlier than ONTAP 9.12.1, any two of these features worked together, but not all three in conjunction.)
* xref:../volumes/enable-large-vol-file-support-task.html[Large volume support] increases FlexGroup volume member size from a maximum of 100TB to a maximum of 300TB.

== Features supported beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1

* xref:../snaplock/index.html[SnapLock volumes]
+
SnapLock does not support the following features with FlexGroup volumes:

** Legal-hold
** Event-based retention
** SnapLock for SnapVault

You configure SnapLock at the FlexGroup level. You cannot configure SnapLock at the member volume level.

* xref:manage-client-async-dir-delete-task.adoc[Client asynchronous directory delete]


== Features supported beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1

* xref:convert-flexvol-svm-dr-relationship-task.adoc[Convert a FlexVol volume to a FlexGroup volume within an SVM DR relationship]

* xref:../volumes/create-flexclone-task.adoc[SVM DR FlexClone support for FlexGroup volumes]


== Features supported beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1

* xref:create-svm-disaster-recovery-relationship-task.html[SVM disaster recovery]
+
Cloning a FlexGroup volume that is part of an SVM DR relationship is not supported.

* SnapMirror fanout relationships of 2 or more (A to B, A to C), with a maximum of 8 fanout legs.
+
xref:create-snapmirror-cascade-fanout-reference.adoc[Considerations for creating SnapMirror cascade and fanout relationships for FlexGroup volumes]

* SnapMirror cascading relationships up to two levels (A to B to C)
+
xref:create-snapmirror-cascade-fanout-reference.adoc[Considerations for creating SnapMirror cascade and fanout relationships for FlexGroup volumes]

== Features supported beginning with ONTAP 9.8

* Restoring a single file from a FlexGroup SnapMirror vault or from a UDP destination
 ** Restore can be from a FlexGroup volume of any geometry to FlexGroup volume of any geometry
 ** Only one file per restore operation is supported
* Converting volumes transitioned from 7-Mode systems to FlexGroup volumes
+
For more information, see Knowledge Base article link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Storage_Software/ONTAP_OS/How_To_Convert_a_Transitioned_FlexVol_to_FlexGroup[How To Convert a Transitioned FlexVol to FlexGroup].

* NFSv4.2
* xref:fast-directory-delete-asynchronous-task.html[Asynchronous delete of files and directories]
* xref:../concept_nas_file_system_analytics_overview.html[Files System Analytics (FSA)]
* FlexGroup as a VMware vSphere datastore
* Additional support for tape backup and restore using NDMP, including the following features:
 ** NDMP restartable backup extension (RBE) and Snapshot Management Extension (SSME)
 ** Environment variables EXCLUDE and MULTI_SUBTREE_NAMES support FlexGroup backups
 ** Introduction of IGNORE_CTIME_MTIME environment variable for FlexGroup backups
 ** Individual file recovery in a FlexGroup using the NDMP_SNAP_RECOVER message, which is part of extension 0x2050
Dump and restore sessions are aborted during an upgrade or revert.

== Features supported beginning with ONTAP 9.7

* xref:../volumes/flexclone-efficient-copies-concept.html[FlexClone volume]
* NFSv4 and NFSv4.1
* pNFS
* xref:../ndmp/index.html[Tape backup and restore by using NDMP]
+
You must be aware of the following points for NDMP support on FlexGroup volumes:

 ** The NDMP_SNAP_RECOVER message in the extension class 0x2050 can be used only for recovering an entire FlexGroup volume.
+
Individual files in a FlexGroup volume cannot be recovered.

 ** NDMP restartable backup extension (RBE) is not supported for FlexGroup volumes.
 ** Environment variables EXCLUDE and MULTI_SUBTREE_NAMES are not supported for FlexGroup volumes.
 ** The `ndmpcopy` command is supported for data transfer between FlexVol and FlexGroup volumes.
+
If you revert from Data ONTAP 9.7 to an earlier version, the incremental transfer information of the previous transfers is not retained and therefore, you must perform a baseline copy after reverting.

* VMware vStorage APIs for Array Integration (VAAI)
* Conversion of a FlexVol volume to a FlexGroup volume
* FlexGroup volumes as FlexCache origin volumes

== Features supported beginning with ONTAP 9.6

* Continuously available SMB shares
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/index.html[MetroCluster configurations^]
* Renaming a FlexGroup volume (`volume rename` command)
* Shrinking or reducing the size of a FlexGroup volume (`volume size` command)
* Elastic sizing
* NetApp aggregate encryption (NAE)
* Cloud Volumes ONTAP

== Features supported beginning with ONTAP 9.5

* ODX copy offload
* Storage-Level Access Guard
* Enhancements to change notifications for SMB shares
+
Change notifications are sent for changes to the parent directory on which the `changenotify` property is set and for changes to all of the subdirectories in that parent directory.

* FabricPool
* Quota enforcement
* Qtree statistics
* Adaptive QoS for files in FlexGroup volumes
* FlexCache (cache only; FlexGroup as origin supported in ONTAP 9.7)

== Features supported beginning with ONTAP 9.4

* FPolicy
* File auditing
* Throughput floor (QoS Min) and adaptive QoS for FlexGroup volumes
* Throughput ceiling (QoS Max) and throughput floor (QoS Min) for files in FlexGroup volumes
+
You use the `volume file modify` command to manage the QoS policy group that is associated with a file.

* Relaxed SnapMirror limits
* SMB 3.x multichannel

== Features supported in ONTAP 9.3 and earlier

* Antivirus configuration
* Change notifications for SMB shares
+
Notifications are sent only for changes to the parent directory on which the `changenotify` property is set. Change notifications are not sent for changes to subdirectories in the parent directory.

* Qtrees
* Throughput ceiling (QoS Max)
* Expand the source FlexGroup volume and destination FlexGroup volume in a SnapMirror relationship
* SnapVault backup and restore
* Unified data protection relationships
