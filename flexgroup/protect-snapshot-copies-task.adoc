You can create Snapshot policies that automatically manage the creation of snapshots or you can manually create snapshots for FlexGroup volumes. A valid snapshot is created for a FlexGroup volume only after ONTAP can successfully create a snapshot for each constituent of the FlexGroup volume.

.About this task

* If you have multiple FlexGroup volumes associated with a Snapshot policy, you should ensure that the FlexGroup volumes schedules do not overlap.
* Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, the maximum number of snapshots supported on a FlexGroup volume is 1023.

NOTE: Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, the `volume snapshot show` command for FlexGroup volumes reports snapshot size using logical blocks, rather than calculating the youngest owned blocks. This new size calculation method might make the snapshot size appear larger than calculations in earlier versions of ONTAP.

.Steps

. Create a Snapshot policy or manually create a snapshot:
+

|===

h| If you want to create a... h| Enter this command...

a|
Snapshot policy
a|
`volume snapshot policy create`

NOTE: The schedules that are associated with the Snapshot policy of a FlexGroup volume must have an interval greater than 30 minutes.

When you create a FlexGroup volume, the `default` Snapshot policy is applied to the FlexGroup volume.
a|
Snapshot manually
a|
`volume snapshot create`

NOTE: After you create a snapshot for a FlexGroup volume, you cannot modify the attributes of the snapshot. If you want to modify the attributes, you must delete and then re-create the snapshot.

|===

Client access to the FlexGroup volume is briefly quiesced when a snapshot is created.

. Verify that a valid snapshot is created for the FlexGroup volume: `volume snapshot show -volume volume_name -fields state`
