You can create a FlexGroup SVM DR relationship by transitioning an existing FlexGroup volume SnapMirror relationship.

.Before you begin

* The FlexGroup volume SnapMirror relationship is in a healthy state.
* The source and destination FlexGroup volumes have the same name.

.Steps

. From the SnapMirror destination, resynchronize the FlexGroup level SnapMirror relationship: `snapmirror resync`
. Create the FlexGroup SVM DR SnapMirror relationship. Use the same SnapMirror policy which is configured on the FlexGroup volume SnapMirror relationships: `snapmirror create -destination-path dest_svm: -source-path src_svm: -identity-preserve true -policy MirrorAllSnapshots`
+
[NOTE]
====
You must use the `-identity-preserve true` option of the `snapmirror create` command when you create your replication relationship.
====
. Verify the relationship is broken off: `snapmirror show -destination-path dest_svm: -source-path src_svm:`

. Stop the destination SVM: `vserver stop -vserver vs_name`

. Resynchronize the SVM SnapMirror relationship: `snapmirror resync -destination-path dest_svm: -source-path src_svm:`

----
snapmirror resync -destination-path fg_vs_renamed: -source-path fg_vs:
Warning: This Vserver has volumes which are the destination of FlexVol or FlexGroup SnapMirror relationships. A resync on the Vserver SnapMirror relationship will cause disruptions in data access
----

. Verify that the SVM DR level SnapMirror relationship reaches a healthy idle state: `snapmirror show -expand`
. Verify that the FlexGroup SnapMirror relationship is in a healthy state: `snapmirror show`
