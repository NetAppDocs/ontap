You can create SnapMirror disaster recovery (DR) relationships for FlexGroup volumes. Beginning with ONTAP 9.3, you can also backup and restore FlexGroup volumes by using SnapVault technology, and you can create a unified data protection relationship that uses the same destination for backup and DR.

// REMOVE THE COMMENTS BELOW BEFORE COMMITTING FINAL DRAFT

// The data protection workflow consists of verifying the cluster and SVM peer relationships, creating a destination volume, creating a job schedule, specifying a policy, creating a data protection relationship, and initializing the relationship.

// image:flexgroups-data-protection-workflow.gif[FlexGroup volume disater recover preparation workflow]

The data protection workflow consists of the following tasks:

* Verify that the link:../peering/create-cluster-relationship-93-later-task.html[clusters] and link:../peering/create-intercluster-svm-peer-relationship-93-later-task.html[SVMs] are peered.
* Create the destination FlexGroup volume with the same constituent count as the source FlexGroup volume.
* link:../data-protection/create-replication-job-schedule-task.html[Create a job schedule.]

Depending on the type of data protection, follow one of these paths:

* If SnapMirror DR:

** Select the default policy `MirrorAllSnapshots` or a custom policy of type `async-mirror`.
** link:create-snapmirror-relationship-task.html[Create a SnapMirror relationship.]
  
* If SnapMirror vault (ONTAP 9.3 and later):

** Select the default policy `XDPDefault` or a custom policy of type `vault`.
** link:create-snapvault-relationship-task.html[Create a SnapMirror vault relationship.]
  
* If unified data protection (ONTAP 9.3 and later):

** Select the default policy `MirrorAndVault` or a custom policy of type `mirror-vault`.
** link:create-unified-data-protection-relationship-task.html[Create a unified data protection relationship.]

* Initialize the data protection relationship.


.About this task

The SnapMirror relationship type is always `XDP` for FlexGroup volumes. The type of data protection that is provided by a SnapMirror relationship is determined by the replication policy that you use. You can use either the default policy or a custom policy of the required type for the replication relationship that you want to create. The following table shows the default policy types and supported custom policy types for different types of data protection relationships.

|===

h| Relationship type h| Default Policy h| Custom policy type
a|
SnapMirror DR
a|
MirrorAllSnapshots
a|
async-mirror
a|
SnapVault backup
a|
XDPDefault
a|
vault
a|
Unified data protection
a|
MirrorAndVault
a|
mirror-vault
|===
The MirrorLatest policy is not supported with FlexGroup volumes.
