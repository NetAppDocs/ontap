[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.7, you can perform an in-place conversion of a FlexVol volume to a FlexGroup volume without requiring a data copy or additional disk space.

.Before you begin

* Transitioned volumes can be converted to FlexGroup volumes beginning in ONTAP 9.8. 
* The FlexVol volume that is being converted must be online.
* The operations and configurations on the FlexVol volume must be compatible with the conversion process.
+
Check for the following conditions that can prevent the conversion from succeeding:

** A FlexVol volume was transitioned from 7-Mode using 7MTT (ONTAP 9.7).
+ 
Transitioned volumes can be converted beginning with ONTAP 9.8.
** Something is enabled on the volume that is not yet supported with FlexGroup volume; for example, SAN LUNs, Windows
NFS, SMB1, Snapshot naming/autodelete, vmalign set, SnapLock, space SLO, or logical space
enforcement/reporting. For more information see link:supported-unsupported-config-concept.html[Supported and unsupported configurations for FlexGroup volumes].
** The SVM where the FlexVol volume to be converted is located is currently using SVM DR.
** NetApp FlexClone volumes are present, and the FlexVol volume is the parent volume. The volume
being converted cannot be a parent or a clone.
** The volume is a NetApp FlexCache origin volume.
** For ONTAP 9.7 and earlier, NetApp Snapshot copies must not exceed 255. For ONTAP 9.8 and later, 1023 Snapshot copies are supported. 
** Storage efficiencies are enabled. These must be disabled and can be reenabled after conversion.
** The volume is a source of a SnapMirror relationship, and the destination has not yet been converted.
** The volume is part of an active (not quiesced) SnapMirror relationship.
** Quotas are enabled. These must be disabled and can be reenabled after conversion.
** Volume names are longer than 197 characters.
** The volume is associated with an application.
+
This is applicable to ONTAP 9.7 only. The limitation is removed in ONTAP 9.8.
** ONTAP processes are running, such as mirroring, jobs, wafliron, NDMP backup, and inode conversion in process.
** The volume is an SVM root volume.
** The volume is too full.
+
If any of these incompatibilities exist, an error message is generated if the FlexVol volume, and the volume conversion is aborted. You can take corrective actions and retry the conversion.

* If a FlexVol volume is currently at 80% or greater maximum capacity, consider copying the data to a newly created FlexGroup volume instead of performing an in-place conversion. Although FlexGroup member volumes will naturally rebalance over time, converting a high-capacity FlexVol volume to a FlexGroup volume may create performance or balance issues that will not quickly be rebalanced across member volumes.
+
[NOTE]
====
Converting a very large FlexGroup volume results in a very full FlexGroup volume member constituent, which can create performance issues. For more information, see the section called "When not to create a FlexGroup volume" in the TR link:https://www.netapp.com/media/12385-tr4571.pdf[FlexGroup volumes - Best Practices and Implementation Guide].
====

.Steps

. Verify that the FlexVol volume is online: `volume show -fields vol_name volume-style-extended,state`
+
----
cluster-1::> volume show my_volume -fields volume-style-extended,state
vserver volume    state  volume-style-extended
------- --------- ------ ---------------------
vs0     my_volume online flexvol
----

. Verify whether the FlexVol volume can be converted without issues:
 .. Log in to the advance privilege mode: `set -privilege advanced`
 .. Verify the conversion process: `volume conversion start -vserver vs1 -volume flexvol -check-only true`
+
You must rectify all errors before converting the volume.
+
[NOTE]
====
You cannot convert a FlexGroup volume back to a FlexVol volume.
====
. Start the conversion: `volume conversion start -vserver svm_name -volume vol_name`
+
----
cluster-1::*> volume conversion start -vserver vs0 -volume my_volume

Warning: Converting flexible volume "my_volume" in Vserver "vs0" to a FlexGroup
         will cause the state of all Snapshot copies from the volume to be set
         to "pre-conversion". Pre-conversion Snapshot copies cannot be
         restored.

[Job 57] Job succeeded: success
----

. Verify that the conversion is successful: `volume show vol_name -fields volume-style-extended,state`
+
----
cluster-1::*> volume show my_volume -fields volume-style-extended,state
vserver volume    state  volume-style-extended
------- --------- ------ ---------------------
vs0     my_volume online flexgroup
----

.Results

The FlexVol volume is converted to a single-member FlexGroup volume.

.After you finish

You can expand the FlexGroup volume, as required.
