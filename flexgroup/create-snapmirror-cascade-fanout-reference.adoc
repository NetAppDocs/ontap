There are support considerations and limitations you should keep in mind when creating SnapMirror cascade and fanout relationships for FlexGroup volumes.

== Considerations for creating cascading relationships

* Each relationship can be either an inter cluster or intra cluster relationship.
* All asynchronous policy types, including async-mirror, mirror-vault, and vault, are supported for both relationships.
* Only "MirrorAllSnapshots," not "MirrorLatest" async-mirror policies are supported.
* Concurrent updates of cascaded XDP relationships is supported.
* Supports removing A to B and B to C and resync A to C or resync C to A.
* A and B FlexGroup volumes also support fanout when all nodes are running ONTAP 9.9.1 or later.
* Restore operations from B or C FlexGroup volumes are supported.
* Transfers on FlexGroup relationships are not support while the destination is the source of a restore relationship.
* The destination of a FlexGroup restore cannot be the destination of any other FlexGroup relationship.
* FlexGroup file restore operations have the same restrictions as regular FlexGroup restore operations.
* All nodes in the cluster where the B and C FlexGroup volumes reside must be running ONTAP 9.9.1 or later.
* All expand and auto expand functionality is supported.
* In a cascade configuration such as A to B to C, if A to B and B to C have different numbers of constituent SnapMirror relationships, then an abort operation from the source is not supported for the B to C SnapMirror relationship.
* System Manager does not support cascading relationships regardless of the ONTAP version.
* When converting an A to B to C set of FlexVol relationship to a FlexGroup relationship, you must convert the B to C hop first.
* All FlexGroup cascade configurations for relationships with policy types supported by REST are also supported by REST APIs in cascading FlexGroup configurations.
* As with FlexVol relationships, FlexGroup cascading is not supported by the `snapmirror protect` command.

== Considerations for creating fanout relationships

* Two or more FlexGroup fanout relationships are supported; for example, A to B, A to C, with a maximum of 8 fanout legs.
* Each relationship can be either intercluster or intracluster.
* Concurrent updates are supported for the two relationships.
* All expand and auto expand functionality is supported.
* If the fanout legs of the relationship have different numbers of constituent SnapMirror relationships, then an abort operation from the source is not supported for the A to B and A to C relationships.
* All nodes in the cluster where the source and destination FlexGroups reside must be running ONTAP 9.9.1 or later.
* All asynchronous policy types currently supported for FlexGroup SnapMirror are supported in fanout relationships.
* You can perform restore operations from B to C FlexGroups.
* All fanout configurations with policy types supported by rest are also supported for REST APIs in FlexGroup fanout configurations.
