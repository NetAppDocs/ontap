You must be aware of the considerations for creating a SnapVault backup relationship and unified data protection relationship for FlexGroup volumes.

* You can resynchronize a SnapVault backup relationship and a unified data protection relationship by using the `-preserve` option that enables you to preserve Snapshot copies on the destination volume that are newer than the latest common snapshot.
* Long-term retention is not supported with FlexGroup volumes.
+
Long-term retention enables creating Snapshot copies directly on the destination volume without requiring to store the Snapshot copies on the source volume.
* The `snapshot` command `expiry-time` option is not supported for FlexGroup volumes.
* Storage efficiency cannot be configured on the destination FlexGroup volume of a SnapVault backup relationship and unified data protection relationship.
* You cannot rename Snapshot copies of a SnapVault backup relationship and unified data protection relationship for FlexGroup volumes.
* A FlexGroup volume can be the source volume of only one backup relationship or restore relationship.
+
A FlexGroup volume cannot be the source of two SnapVault relationships, two restore relationships, or a SnapVault backup relationship and a restore relationship.

* If you delete a snapshot on the source FlexGroup volume and re-create a snapshot with the same name, the next update transfer to the destination FlexGroup volume fails if the destination volume has a snapshot of the same name.
+
This is because Snapshot copies cannot be renamed for FlexGroup volumes.
