You can set up, manage, and protect FlexGroup volumes for scalability and performance. A FlexGroup volume is a scale-out volume that provides high performance along with automatic load distribution.

You can configure FlexGroup volumes if the following are true:

* You want to use best practices, not explore every available option.
* You have cluster administrator privileges, not SVM administrator privileges.

NOTE: Beginning with ONTAP 9.5, FlexGroup volumes replace Infinite Volumes, which are not supported in ONTAP 9.5 or later releases.

See the link:supported-unsupported-config-concept.html[supported and unsupported configurations for FlexGroup volumes] for more information.

// The Infinite Volumes Management information has been moved to the documentation archive.
