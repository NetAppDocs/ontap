[.lead]
You can create a SnapMirror relationship between the source FlexGroup volume and the destination FlexGroup volume on a peered SVM for replicating data for disaster recovery. You can use the mirror copies of the FlexGroup volume to recover data when a disaster occurs.

.Before you begin

You must have created the cluster peering relationship and SVM peering relationship.

link:../peering/index.html[Cluster and SVM peering]

.About this task

* Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, you can use the ONTAP CLI to create SnapMirror cascade and fanout relationships for FlexGroup volumes.
For details, see link:create-snapmirror-cascade-fanout-reference.html[Considerations for creating SnapMirror cascade and fanout relationships for FlexGroups].
* You can create both intercluster SnapMirror relationships and intracluster SnapMirror relationships for FlexGroup volumes.
* Beginning with ONTAP 9.3, you can expand FlexGroup volumes that are in a SnapMirror relationship.
+
If you are using a version of ONTAP earlier than ONTAP 9.3, you must not expand FlexGroup volumes after a SnapMirror relationship is established; however, you can increase the capacity of FlexGroup volumes after establishing a SnapMirror relationship. If you expand the source FlexGroup volume after breaking the SnapMirror relationship in releases earlier than ONTAP 9.3, you must perform a baseline transfer to the destination FlexGroup volume.

.Steps

. Create a destination FlexGroup volume of type `DP` that has the same number of constituents as that of the source FlexGroup volume:
 .. From the source cluster, determine the number of constituents in the source FlexGroup volume: `volume show -volume volume_name* -is-constituent true`

. Create a job schedule: `job schedule cron create -name job_name -month month -dayofweek day_of_week -day day_of_month -hour hour -minute minute`
+
For the `-month`, `-dayofweek`, and `-hour` options, you can specify `all` to run the job every month, every day of the week, and every hour, respectively.
+
The following example creates a job schedule named `my_weekly` that runs on Saturdays at 3:00 a.m.:
+
----
cluster1::> job schedule cron create -name my_weekly -dayofweek "Saturday" -hour 3 -minute 0
----

. Create a custom policy of type `async-mirror` for the SnapMirror relationship: `snapmirror policy create -vserver SVM -policy snapmirror_policy -type async-mirror`
+
If you do not create a custom policy, you should specify the `MirrorAllSnapshots` policy for SnapMirror relationships.

. From the destination cluster, create a SnapMirror relationship between the source FlexGroup volume and the destination FlexGroup volume: `snapmirror create -source-path src_svm:src_flexgroup -destination-path dest_svm:dest_flexgroup -type XDP -policy snapmirror_policy -schedule sched_name`
+
SnapMirror relationships for FlexGroup volumes must be of type `XDP`.
+
If you specify a throttle value for the SnapMirror relationship for the FlexGroup volume, each constituent uses the same throttle value. The throttle value is not divided among the constituents.
+
[NOTE]
====
You cannot use SnapMirror labels of Snapshot copies for FlexGroup volumes.
====
+
In ONTAP 9.4 and earlier, if the policy is not specified with the `snapmirror create` command, the `MirrorAllSnapshots` policy is used by default. In ONTAP 9.5, if the policy is not specified with the `snapmirror create` command, the `MirrorAndVault` policy is used by default.
+
----
cluster2::> snapmirror create -source-path vss:srcFG -destination-path vsd:dstFG -type XDP -policy MirrorAllSnapshots -schedule hourly
Operation succeeded: snapmirror create for the relationship with destination "vsd:dstFG".
----

. From the destination cluster, initialize the SnapMirror relationship by performing a baseline transfer: `snapmirror initialize -destination-path dest_svm:dest_flexgroup`
+
After the baseline transfer is completed, the destination FlexGroup volume is updated periodically based on the schedule of the SnapMirror relationship.
+
----
cluster2::> snapmirror initialize -destination-path vsd:dstFG
Operation is queued: snapmirror initialize of destination "vsd:dstFG".
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you have created any SnapMirror relationship between FlexGroup volumes with the source cluster running ONTAP 9.3 and the destination cluster running ONTAP 9.2 or earlier, and if you create any qtrees in the source FlexGroup volume, the SnapMirror updates fail. To recover from this situation, you must delete all of the non-default qtrees in the FlexGroup volume, disable the qtree functionality on the FlexGroup volume, and then delete all of the Snapshot copies that are enabled with the qtree functionality.
====

.After you finish

You should set up the destination SVM for data access by setting up required configurations such as LIFs and export policies.
