ONTAP introduced limits for the maximum number of UNIX users and groups in the cluster, and commands to manage these limits. These limits can help avoid performance issues by preventing administrators from creating too many local UNIX users and groups in the cluster.

There is a limit for the combined number of local UNIX user groups and group members. There is a separate limit for local UNIX users. The limits are cluster-wide. Each of these new limits is set to a default value that you can modify up to a preassigned hard limit.
