ONTAP evaluates three levels of security to determine whether an entity is authorized to perform a requested action on files and directories residing on an SVM. Access is determined by the effective permissions after evaluation of the three security levels.

Any storage object can contain up to three types of security layers:

* Export (NFS) and share (SMB) security
+
Export and share security applies to client access to a given NFS export or SMB share. Users with administrative privileges can manage export and share-level security from SMB and NFS clients.

* Storage-Level Access Guard file and directory security
+
Storage-Level Access Guard security applies to SMB and NFS client access to SVM volumes. Only NTFS access permissions are supported. For ONTAP to perform security checks on UNIX users for access to data on volumes for which Storage-Level Access Guard has been applied, the UNIX user must map to a Windows user on the SVM that owns the volume.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you view the security settings on a file or directory from an NFS or SMB client, you will not see Storage-Level Access Guard security. Storage-Level Access Guard security cannot be revoked from a client, even by a system (Windows or UNIX) administrator.
====

* NTFS, UNIX, and NFSv4 native file-level security
+
Native file-level security exists on the file or directory that represents the storage object. You can set file-level security from a client. File permissions are effective regardless of whether SMB or NFS is used to access the data.
