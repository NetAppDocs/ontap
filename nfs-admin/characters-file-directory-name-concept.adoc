If you are accessing a file or directory from clients with different operating systems, you should use characters that are valid in both operating systems.

For example, if you use UNIX to create a file or directory, do not use a colon (:) in the name because the colon is not allowed in MS-DOS file or directory names. Because restrictions on valid characters vary from one operating system to another, see the documentation for your client operating system for more information about prohibited characters.
