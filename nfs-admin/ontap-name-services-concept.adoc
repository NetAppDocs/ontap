ONTAP uses name services to obtain information about users and clients. ONTAP uses this information to authenticate users accessing data on or administering the storage system, and to map user credentials in a mixed environment.

When you configure the storage system, you must specify what name services you want ONTAP to use for obtaining user credentials for authentication. ONTAP supports the following name services:

* Local users (file)
* External NIS domains (NIS)
* External LDAP domains (LDAP)

You use the `vserver services name-service ns-switch` command family to configure SVMs with the sources to search for network information and the order in which to search them. These commands provide the equivalent functionality of the `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file on UNIX systems.

When an NFS client connects to the SVM, ONTAP checks the specified name services to obtain the UNIX credentials for the user. If name services are configured correctly and ONTAP can obtain the UNIX credentials, ONTAP successfully authenticates the user.

In an environment with mixed security styles, ONTAP might have to map user credentials. You must configure name services appropriately for your environment to allow ONTAP to properly map user credentials.

ONTAP also uses name services for authenticating SVM administrator accounts. You must keep this in mind when configuring or modifying the name service switch to avoid accidentally disabling authentication for SVM administrator accounts. For more information about SVM administration users, see link:../authentication/index.html[Administrator authentication and RBAC].
