[.lead]
You should be aware of several limitations of ONTAP support for NFSv4.

* The delegation feature is not supported by every client type.
* In ONTAP 9.4 and earlier releases, names with non-ASCII characters on volumes other than UTF8 volumes are rejected by the storage system.
+
In ONTAP 9.5 and later releases, volumes created with the utf8mb4 language setting and mounted using NFS v4 are no longer subject to this restriction.

* All file handles are persistent; the server does not give volatile file handles.
* Migration and replication are not supported.
* NFSv4 clients are not supported with read-only load-sharing mirrors.
+
ONTAP routes NFSv4 clients to the source of the load-sharing mirror for direct read and write access.

* Named attributes are not supported.
* All recommended attributes are supported, except for the following:
 ** `archive`
 ** `hidden`
 ** `homogeneous`
 ** `mimetype`
 ** `quota_avail_hard`
 ** `quota_avail_soft`
 ** `quota_used`
 ** `system`
 ** `time_backup`
+
[NOTE]
Although it does not support the `quota*` attributes, ONTAP does support user and group quotas through the RQUOTA side band protocol.
