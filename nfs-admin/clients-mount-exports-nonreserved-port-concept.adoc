The `-mount-rootonly` option must be disabled on a storage system that must support clients that mount NFS exports using a nonreserved port even when the user is logged in as root. Such clients include Hummingbird clients and Solaris NFS/IPv6 clients.

If the `-mount-rootonly` option is enabled, ONTAP does not allow NFS clients that use nonreserved ports, meaning ports with numbers higher than 1,023, to mount NFS exports.
