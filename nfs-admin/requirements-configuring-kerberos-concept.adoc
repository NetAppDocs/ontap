[.lead]
Before you configure Kerberos with NFS on your system, you must verify that certain items in your network and storage environment are properly configured.

[NOTE]
====
The steps to configure your environment depend on what version and type of client operating system, domain controller, Kerberos, DNS, etc., that you are using. Documenting all these variables is beyond the scope of this document. For more information, see the respective documentation for each component.

For a detailed example of how to set up ONTAP and Kerberos 5 with NFSv3 and NFSv4 in an environment using Windows Server 2008 R2 Active Directory and Linux hosts, see technical report 4073.

====

The following items should be configured first:

== Network environment requirements

* Kerberos
+
You must have a working Kerberos setup with a key distribution center (KDC), such as Windows Active Directory based Kerberos or MIT Kerberos.
+
NFS servers must use `nfs` as the primary component of their machine principal.

* Directory service
+
You must use a secure directory service in your environment, such as Active Directory or OpenLDAP, that is configured to use LDAP over SSL/TLS.

* NTP
+
You must have a working time server running NTP. This is necessary to prevent Kerberos authentication failure due to time skew.

* Domain name resolution (DNS)
+
Each UNIX client and each SVM LIF must have a proper service record (SRV) registered with the KDC under forward and reverse lookup zones. All participants must be properly resolvable via DNS.

* User accounts
+
Each client must have a user account in the Kerberos realm. NFS servers must use "`nfs`" as the primary component of their machine principal.

== NFS client requirements

* NFS
+
Each client must be properly configured to communicate over the network using NFSv3 or NFSv4.
+
Clients must support RFC1964 and RFC2203.

* Kerberos
+
Each client must be properly configured to use Kerberos authentication, including the following details:

    ** Encryption for TGS communication is enabled.
+
AES-256 for strongest security.
+
    ** The most secure encryption type for TGT communication is enabled.
    ** The Kerberos realm and domain are configured correctly.
    ** GSS is enabled.
+
When using machine credentials:
+
    ** Do not run `gssd` with the `-n` parameter.
    ** Do not run `kinit` as the root user.
+
* Each client must use the most recent and updated operating system version.
+
This provides the best compatibility and reliability for AES encryption with Kerberos.

* DNS
+
Each client must be properly configured to use DNS for correct name resolution.

* NTP
+
Each client must be synchronizing with the NTP server.

* Host and domain information
+
Each client's `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/resolv.conf` files must contain the correct host name and DNS information, respectively.

* Keytab files
+
Each client must have a keytab file from the KDC. The realm must be in uppercase letters. The encryption type must be AES-256 for strongest security.

* Optional: For best performance, clients benefit from having at least two network interfaces: one for communicating with the local area network and one for communicating with the storage network.

== Storage system requirements

* NFS license
+
The storage system must have a valid NFS license installed.

* CIFS license
+
The CIFS license is optional. It is only required for checking Windows credentials when using multiprotocol name mapping. It is not required in a strict UNIX-only environment.

* SVM
+
You must have at least one SVM configured on the system.

* DNS on the SVM
+
You must have configured DNS on each SVM.

* NFS server
+
You must have configured NFS on the SVM.

* AES encryption
+
For strongest security, you must configure the NFS server to allow only AES-256 encryption for Kerberos.

* SMB server
+
If you are running a multiprotocol environment, you must have configured SMB on the SVM. The SMB server is required for multiprotocol name mapping.

* Volumes
+
You must have a root volume and at least one data volume configured for use by the SVM.

* Root volume
+
The root volume of the SVM must have the following configuration:
+
[cols="2*",options="header"]
|===
| Name| Setting
a|
Security style
a|
UNIX
a|
UID
a|
root or ID 0
a|
GID
a|
root or ID 0
a|
UNIX permissions
a|
777
|===
In contrast to the root volume, data volumes can have either security style.

* UNIX groups
+
The SVM must have the following UNIX groups configured:
+
[cols="2*",options="header"]
|===
| Group name| Group ID
a|
daemon
a|
1
a|
root
a|
0
a|
pcuser
a|
65534 (created automatically by ONTAP when you create the SVM)
|===

* UNIX users
+
The SVM must have the following UNIX users configured:
+
[cols="4*",options="header"]
|===
| User name| User ID| Primary group ID| Comment
a|
nfs
a|
500
a|
0
a|
Required for GSS INIT phase  
 
The first component of the NFS client user SPN is used as the user.
a|
pcuser
a|
65534
a|
65534
a|
Required for NFS and CIFS multiprotocol use    

Created and added to the pcuser group automatically by ONTAP when you create the SVM.
a|
root
a|
0
a|
0
a|
Required for mounting
|===
The nfs user is not required if a Kerberos-UNIX name mapping exists for the SPN of the NFS client user.

* Export policies and rules
+
You must have configured export policies with the necessary export rules for the root and data volumes and qtrees. If all volumes of the SVM are accessed over Kerberos, you can set the export rule options `-rorule`, `-rwrule`, and `-superuser` for the root volume to `krb5` , `krb5i`, or `krb5p`.

* Kerberos-UNIX name mapping
+
If you want the user identified by the NFS client user SPN to have root permissions, you must create a name mapping to root.
