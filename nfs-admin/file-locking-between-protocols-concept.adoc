File locking is a method used by client applications to prevent a user from accessing a file previously opened by another user. How ONTAP locks files depends on the protocol of the client.

If the client is an NFS client, locks are advisory; if the client is an SMB client, locks are mandatory.

Because of differences between the NFS and SMB file locks, an NFS client might fail to access a file previously opened by an SMB application.

The following occurs when an NFS client attempts to access a file locked by an SMB application:

* In mixed or NTFS volumes, file manipulation operations such as `rm`, `rmdir`, and `mv` can cause the NFS application to fail.
* NFS read and write operations are denied by SMB deny-read and deny-write open modes, respectively.
* NFS write operations fail when the written range of the file is locked with an exclusive SMB bytelock.

In UNIX security-style volumes, NFS unlink and rename operations ignore SMB lock state and allow access to the file. All other NFS operations on UNIX security-style volumes honor SMB lock state.
