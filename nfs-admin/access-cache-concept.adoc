ONTAP uses an access cache to store the results of export policy rule evaluation for client access operations to a volume or qtree. This results in performance improvements because the information can be retrieved much faster from the access cache than going through the export policy rule evaluation process every time a client sends an I/O request.

Whenever an NFS client sends an I/O request to access data on a volume or qtree, ONTAP must evaluate each I/O request to determine whether to grant or deny the I/O request. This evaluation involves checking every export policy rule of the export policy associated with the volume or qtree. If the path to the volume or qtree involves crossing one or more junction points, this might require performing this check for multiple export policies along the path.

Note that this evaluation occurs for every I/O request sent from an NFS client, such as read, write, list, copy and other operations; not just for initial mount requests.

After ONTAP has identified the applicable export policy rules and decided whether to allow or deny the request, ONTAP then creates an entry in the access cache to store this information.

When an NFS client sends an I/O request, ONTAP notes the IP address of the client, the ID of the SVM, and the export policy associated with the target volume or qtree, and first checks the access cache for a matching entry. If a matching entry exists in the access cache, ONTAP uses the stored information to allow or deny the I/O request. If a matching entry does not exist, ONTAP then goes through the normal process of evaluating all applicable policy rules as explained above.

Access cache entries that are not actively used are not refreshed. This reduces unnecessary and wasteful communication with external name serves.

Retrieving the information from the access cache is much faster than going through the entire export policy rule evaluation process for every I/O request. Therefore, using the access cache greatly improves performance by reducing the overhead of client access checks.
