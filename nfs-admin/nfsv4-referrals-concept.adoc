When you enable NFSv4 referrals, ONTAP provides "`intra-SVM`" referrals to NFSv4 clients. Intra-SVM referral is when a cluster node receiving the NFSv4 request refers the NFSv4 client to another logical interface (LIF) on the storage virtual machine (SVM).

The NFSv4 client should access the path that received the referral at the target LIF from that point onward. The original cluster node provides such a referral when it determines that there exists a LIF in the SVM that is resident on the cluster node on which the data volume resides, thereby enabling the clients faster access to the data and avoiding extra cluster communication.
