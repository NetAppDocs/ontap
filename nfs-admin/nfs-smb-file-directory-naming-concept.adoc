File and directory naming conventions depend on both the network clients`' operating systems and the file-sharing protocols, in addition to language settings on the ONTAP cluster and clients.

The operating system and the file-sharing protocols determine the following:

* Characters a file name can use
* Case-sensitivity of a file name

ONTAP supports multi-byte characters in file, directory, and qtree names, depending on the ONTAP release.
