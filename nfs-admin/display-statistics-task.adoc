You can display NFS statistics for storage virtual machines (SVMs) on the storage system to monitor performance and diagnose issues.

.Steps

. Use the `statistics catalog object show` command to identify the NFS objects from which you can view data.
+
`statistics catalog object show -object nfs*`

. Use the `statistics start` and optional `statistics stop` commands to collect a data sample from one or more objects.
. Use the `statistics show` command to view the sample data.

.Example: Monitoring NFSv3 performance

The following example shows performance data for the NFSv3 protocol.

The following command starts data collection for a new sample:

----
vs1::> statistics start -object nfsv3 -sample-id nfs_sample
----

The following command shows data from the sample by specifying counters that show the number of successful read and write requests versus the total number of read and write requests:

----

vs1::> statistics show -sample-id nfs_sample -counter read_total|write_total|read_success|write_success

Object: nfsv3
Instance: vs1
Start-time: 2/11/2013 15:38:29
End-time: 2/11/2013 15:38:41
Cluster: cluster1

    Counter                                           Value
    --------------------------- ---------------------------
    read_success                                      40042
    read_total                                        40042
    write_success                                   1492052
    write_total                                     1492052
