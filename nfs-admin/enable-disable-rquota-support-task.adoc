[.lead]
The remote quota protocol (rquota) enables NFS clients to obtain quota information for users from a remote machine. Support for rquota versions varies based on your version of ONTAP.

* rquota v1 is supported in ONTAP 9 and later. 
* rquota v2 is supported in ONTAP 9.12.1 and later.
+
If you upgrade from rquota v1 to rquota v2, you might notice an unexpected change in your user quota limit.  This change is due to the difference in the way the quota is calculated between rquota v1 and rquota v2.
