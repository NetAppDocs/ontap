ONTAP supports file access from Windows NFSv3 clients. This means that clients running Windows operating systems with NFSv3 support can access files on NFSv3 exports on the cluster. To successfully use this functionality, you must properly configure the storage virtual machine (SVM) and be aware of certain requirements and limitations.

.About this task

By default, Windows NFSv3 client support is disabled.

.Before you begin

NFSv3 must be enabled on the SVM.

.Steps

. Enable Windows NFSv3 client support:
+
`vserver nfs modify -vserver _svm_name_ -v3-ms-dos-client enabled -mount-rootonly disabled`
. On all SVMs that support Windows NFSv3 clients, disable the `-enable-ejukebox` and `-v3-connection-drop` parameters: 
+
`vserver nfs modify -vserver vserver_name -enable-ejukebox false -v3-connection-drop disabled`
+
Windows NFSv3 clients can now mount exports on the storage system.

. Ensure that each Windows NFSv3 client uses hard mounts by specifying the `-o mtype=hard` option.
+
This is required to ensure reliable mounts.
+
`mount -o mtype=hard \\10.53.33.10\vol\vol1 z:\`
