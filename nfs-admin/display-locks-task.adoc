You can display information about the current file locks, including what types of locks are held and what the lock state is, details about byte-range locks, sharelock modes, delegation locks, and opportunistic locks, and whether locks are opened with durable or persistent handles.

.About this task

The client IP address cannot be displayed for locks established through NFSv4 or NFSv4.1.

By default, the command displays information about all locks. You can use command parameters to display information about locks for a specific storage virtual machine (SVM) or to filter the command's output by other criteria.

The `vserver locks show` command displays information about four types of locks:

* Byte-range locks, which lock only a portion of a file.
* Share locks, which lock open files.
* Opportunistic locks, which control client-side caching over SMB.
* Delegations, which control client-side caching over NFSv4.x.

By specifying optional parameters, you can determine important information about each lock type. 
Learn more about `vserver locks show` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/vserver-locks-show.html[ONTAP command reference^].

.Step

. Display information about locks by using the `vserver locks show` command.

.Examples

The following example displays summary information for an NFSv4 lock on a file with the path `/vol1/file1`. The sharelock access mode is write-deny_none, and the lock was granted with write delegation:

----
cluster1::> vserver locks show

Vserver: vs0
Volume  Object Path               LIF         Protocol  Lock Type   Client
------- ------------------------- ----------- --------- ----------- -------
vol1    /vol1/file1               lif1        nfsv4     share-level -
               Sharelock Mode: write-deny_none
                                                        delegation  -
               Delegation Type: write

The following example displays detailed oplock and sharelock information about the SMB lock on a file with the path `/data2/data2_2/intro.pptx`. A durable handle is granted on the file with a share lock access mode of write-deny_none to a client with an IP address of 10.3.1.3. A lease oplock is granted with a batch oplock level:
