Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, nconnect functionality is available by default when NFSv4.1 is enabled.

Earlier NFS client implementations use only a single TCP connection with a mount. In ONTAP, a single TCP connection can become a bottleneck with increasing IOPS. 

nconnect improves NFS client performance by allowing multiple TCP connections (up to 16) for a single mount, helping to overcome the performance bottleneck that can occur with a single TCP connection as IOPS increases. 

NFSv4.1 is enabled by default in ONTAP 9.9.1 and later. In earlier releases, you can enable it by specifying the `-v4.1` option and setting it to `enabled` when creating an NFS server on the storage virtual machine (SVM).

ONTAP does not support NFSv4.1 directory and file level delegations.
