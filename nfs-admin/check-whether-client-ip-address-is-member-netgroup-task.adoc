When troubleshooting NFS client access issues related to netgroups, you can use the `vserver export-policy netgroup check-membership` command to help determine whether a client IP is a member of a certain netgroup.

.About this task

Checking netgroup membership enables you to determine whether ONTAP is aware that a client is or is not member of a netgroup. It also lets you know whether the ONTAP netgroup cache is in a transient state while refreshing netgroup information. This information can help you understand why a client might be unexpectedly granted or denied access.

.Step

. Check the netgroup membership of a client IP address: `vserver export-policy netgroup check-membership -vserver vserver_name -netgroup netgroup_name -client-ip client_ip`
+
The command can return the following results:

 ** The client is a member of the netgroup.
+
This was confirmed through a reverse lookup scan or a netgroup-by-host search.

 ** The client is a member of the netgroup.
+
It was found in the ONTAP netgroup cache.

 ** The client is not a member of the netgroup.
 ** The membership of the client cannot yet be determined because ONTAP is currently refreshing the netgroup cache.
+
Until this is done, membership cannot be explicitly ruled in or out. Use the `vserver export-policy netgroup queue show` command to monitor the loading of the netgroup and retry the check after it is finished.

.Example

The following example checks whether a client with the IP address 172.17.16.72 is a member of the netgroup mercury on the SVM vs1:

----
 cluster1::> vserver export-policy netgroup check-membership -vserver vs1 -netgroup  mercury -client-ip 172.17.16.72
