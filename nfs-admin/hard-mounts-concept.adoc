When troubleshooting mounting problems, you need to be sure that you are using the correct mount type. NFS supports two mount types: soft mounts and hard mounts. You should use only hard mounts for reliability reasons.

You should not use soft mounts, especially when there is a possibility of frequent NFS timeouts. Race conditions can occur as a result of these timeouts, which can lead to data corruption.
