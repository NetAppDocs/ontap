When clients experience access failures due to name service issues, you can use the `vserver services name-service getxxbyyy` command family to manually perform various name service lookups and examine the details and results of the lookup to help with troubleshooting.

.About this task

* For each command, you can specify the following:
 ** Name of the node or storage virtual machine (SVM) to perform the lookup on.
+
This enables you to test name service lookups for a specific node or SVM to narrow the search for a potential name service configuration issue.

 ** Whether to show the source used for the lookup.
+
This enables you to check whether the correct source was used.
* ONTAP selects the service for performing the lookup based on the configured name service switch order.
* These commands are available at the advanced privilege level.

.Steps
. Perform one of the following actions:

| To retrieve the...| Use the command...
a|
IP address of a host name
a|
`vserver services name-service getxxbyyy getaddrinfo`     `vserver services name-service getxxbyyy gethostbyname` (IPv4 addresses only)
a|
Members of a group by group ID
a|
`vserver services name-service getxxbyyy getgrbygid`
a|
Members of a group by group name
a|
`vserver services name-service getxxbyyy getgrbyname`
a|
List of groups a user belongs to
a|
`vserver services name-service getxxbyyy getgrlist`
a|
Host name of an IP address
a|
`vserver services name-service getxxbyyy getnameinfo`     `vserver services name-service getxxbyyy gethostbyaddr` (IPv4 addresses only)
a|
User information by user name
a|
`vserver services name-service getxxbyyy getpwbyname`     You can test name resolution of RBAC users by specifying the `-use-rbac` parameter as `true`.
a|
User information by user ID
a|
`vserver services name-service getxxbyyy getpwbyuid`
You can test name resolution of RBAC users by specifying the `-use-rbac` parameter as `true`.
a|
Netgroup membership of a client
a|
`vserver services name-service getxxbyyy netgrp`
a|
Netgroup membership of a client using netgroup-by-host search
a|
`vserver services name-service getxxbyyy netgrpbyhost`

The following example shows a DNS lookup test for the SVM vs1 by attempting to obtain the IP address for the host acast1.eng.example.com:
----
cluster1::*> vserver services name-service getxxbyyy getaddrinfo -vserver vs1 -hostname acast1.eng.example.com -address-family all -show-source true
Source used for lookup: DNS
Host name: acast1.eng.example.com
Canonical Name: acast1.eng.example.com
IPv4: 10.72.8.29
----
The following example shows a NIS lookup test for the SVM vs1 by attempting to retrieve user information for a user with the UID 501768:
----
cluster1::*> vserver services name-service getxxbyyy getpwbyuid -vserver vs1 -userID 501768 -show-source true
Source used for lookup: NIS
pw_name: jsmith
pw_passwd: $1$y8rA4XX7$/DDOXAvc2PC/IsNFozfIN0
pw_uid: 501768
pw_gid: 501768
pw_gecos:
pw_dir: /home/jsmith
pw_shell: /bin/bash
----
The following example shows an LDAP lookup test for the SVM vs1 by attempting to retrieve user information for a user with the name ldap1:
----
cluster1::*> vserver services name-service getxxbyyy getpwbyname -vserver vs1 -username ldap1 -use-rbac false -show-source true
Source used for lookup: LDAP
pw_name: ldap1
pw_passwd: {crypt}JSPM6yc/ilIX6
pw_uid: 10001
pw_gid: 3333
pw_gecos: ldap1 user
pw_dir: /u/ldap1
pw_shell: /bin/csh
----
The following example shows a netgroup lookup test for the SVM vs1 by attempting to find out whether the client dnshost0 is a member of the netgroup lnetgroup136:
----
cluster1::*> vserver services name-service getxxbyyy netgrp -vserver vs1 -netgroup lnetgroup136 -client dnshost0 -show-source true
Source used for lookup: LDAP
dnshost0 is a member of lnetgroup136

. Analyze the results of the test you performed and take the necessary action.

| If the...| Check the...
a|
Host name or IP address lookup failed or yielded incorrect results
a|
DNS configuration
a|
Lookup queried an incorrect source
a|
Name service switch configuration
a|
User or group lookup failed or yielded incorrect results
a|
* Name service switch configuration    
* Source configuration (local files, NIS domain, LDAP client)
* Network configuration (for example, LIFs and routes)
a|
Host name lookup failed or timed out, and the DNS server does not resolve DNS short names (for example, host1)
a|
DNS configuration for top-level domain (TLD) queries. You can disable TLD queries using the `-is-tld-query-enabled false` option to the `vserver services name-service dns modify` command.
