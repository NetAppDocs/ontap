ONTAP supports all the mandatory functionality in NFSv4.0 except the SPKM3 and LIPKEY security mechanisms.

The following NFSV4 functionality is supported:

* *COMPOUND*
+
Allows a client to request multiple file operations in a single remote procedure call (RPC) request.

* *File delegation*
+
Allows the server to delegate file control to some types of clients for read and write access.

* *Pseudo-fs*
+
Used by NFSv4 servers to determine mount points on the storage system. There is no mount protocol in NFSv4.

* *Locking*
+
Lease-based. There are no separate Network Lock Manager (NLM) or Network Status Monitor (NSM) protocols in NFSv4.

For more information about the NFSv4.0 protocol, see RFC 3530.
