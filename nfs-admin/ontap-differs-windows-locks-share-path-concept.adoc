Unlike Windows, ONTAP does not lock each component of the path to an open file while the file is open. This behavior also affects SMB share paths.

Because ONTAP does not lock each component of the path, it is possible to rename a path component above the open file or share, which can cause problems for certain applications, or can cause the share path in the SMB configuration to be invalid. This can cause the share to be inaccessible.

To avoid issues caused by renaming path components, you can apply Windows Access Control List (ACL) security settings that prevent users or applications from renaming critical directories.
