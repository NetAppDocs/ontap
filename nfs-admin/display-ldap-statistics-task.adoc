[.lead]
You can display LDAP statistics for storage virtual machines (SVMs) on a storage system to monitor the performance and diagnose issues.

.Before you begin

* You must have configured an LDAP client on the SVM.
* You must have identified LDAP objects from which you can view data.

.Step

. View the performance data for counter objects:
+
`statistics show`

.Examples

The following example displays statistics for the sample named *smpl_1* for counters: avg_processor_busy and cpu_busy

----
cluster1::*> statistics start -object system -counter avg_processor_busy|cpu_busy -sample-id smpl_1
Statistics collection is being started for Sample-id: smpl_1

cluster1::*> statistics stop -sample-id smpl_1
Statistics collection is being stopped for Sample-id: smpl_1

cluster1::*> statistics show -sample-id smpl_1
Object: system
Instance: cluster
Start-time: 8/2/2012 18:27:53
End-time: 8/2/2012 18:27:56
Cluster: cluster1
   Counter                                                     Value
   -------------------------------- --------------------------------
   avg_processor_busy                                             6%
   cpu_busy
