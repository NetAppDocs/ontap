If you do not specify the security style when creating a new FlexVol volume or a qtree, it inherits its security style in different ways.

Security styles are inherited in the following manner:

* A FlexVol volume inherits the security style of the root volume of its containing SVM.
* A qtree inherits the security style of its containing FlexVol volume.
* A file or directory inherits the security style of its containing FlexVol volume or qtree.
