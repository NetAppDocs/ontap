You can configure the length of time that ONTAP stores credentials for NFS users in its internal cache (time-to-live, or TTL) by modifying the NFS server of the storage virtual machine (SVM). This enables you to alleviate certain issues related to high load on name servers or changes in credentials affecting NFS user access.

h| If you want to modify the TTL for cached... h| Use the command...
a|
Positive credentials
a|
`vserver nfs modify -vserver vserver_name -cached-cred-positive-ttl time_to_live`

The TTL is measured in milliseconds. Beginning in ONTAP 9.10.1 and later the default is 1 hour (3,600,000 milliseconds).  In ONTAP 9.9.1 and earlier the default is 24 hours (86,400,000 milliseconds).  The allowed range for this value is 1 minute (60000 milliseconds) through 7 days (604,800,000 milliseconds).

Negative credentials
a|
`vserver nfs modify -vserver vserver_name -cached-cred-negative-ttl time_to_live`

The TTL is measured in milliseconds. The default is 2 hours (7,200,000 milliseconds). The allowed range for this value is 1 minute (60000 milliseconds) through 7 days (604,800,000 milliseconds).
