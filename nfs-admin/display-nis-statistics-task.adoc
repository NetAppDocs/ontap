You can display NIS statistics for storage virtual machines (SVMs) on the storage system to monitor performance and diagnose issues.

.Steps

. Use the `statistics catalog object show` command to identify the NIS objects from which you can view data.
+
`statistics catalog object show -object external_service_op*`

. Use the `statistics start` and `statistics stop` commands to collect a data sample from one or more objects.
. Use the `statistics show` command to view the sample data.

== Monitoring NIS statistics

The following examples display performance data for NIS queries. The following commands start data collection for a new sample:

----
vs1::*> statistics start -object external_service_op -sample-id nis_sample1
vs1::*> statistics start -object external_service_op_error -sample-id nis_sample2
----

The following command displays data from the sample by specifying counters that show the number of NIS queries sent versus the number of NIS queries received, failed, or timed out:

----
vs1::*> statistics show -sample-id nis_sample1 -counter instance|num_requests_sent|num_responses_received|num_successful_responses|num_timeouts|num_request_failures|num_not_found_responses

Object: external_service_op
Instance: vs1:NIS:Query:10.227.13.221
Start-time: 3/8/2016 11:27:39
End-time: 3/8/2016 11:27:56
Elapsed-time: 17s
Scope: vs1

    Counter                                                     Value
    -------------------------------- --------------------------------
    num_not_found_responses                                         0
    num_request_failures                                            1
    num_requests_sent                                               2
    num_responses_received                                          1
    num_successful_responses                                        1
    num_timeouts                                                    0

The following command displays data from the sample by specifying counters that show the number of times a specific error was received for a NIS query on the particular server:

----
vs1::*> statistics show -sample-id nis_sample2 -counter server_ip_address|error_string|count

Object: external_service_op_error
Instance: vs1:NIS:Query:YP_NOTFOUND:10.227.13.221
Start-time: 3/8/2016 11:33:05
End-time: 3/8/2016 11:33:10
Elapsed-time: 5s
Scope: vs1

    Counter                                                     Value
    -------------------------------- --------------------------------
    count                                                           1
    error_string                                          YP_NOTFOUND
    server_ip_address                                   10.227.13.221
