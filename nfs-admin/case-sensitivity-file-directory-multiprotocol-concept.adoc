File and directory names are case-sensitive for NFS clients and case-insensitive but case-preserving for SMB clients. You must understand what the implications are in a multiprotocol environment and the actions you might need to take when specifying the path while creating SMB shares and when accessing data within the shares.

If an SMB client creates a directory named `testdir`, both SMB and NFS clients display the file name as `testdir`. However, if an SMB user later tries to create a directory name `TESTDIR`, the name is not allowed because, to the SMB client, that name currently exists. If an NFS user later creates a directory named `TESTDIR`, NFS and SMB clients display the directory name differently, as follows:

* On NFS clients, you see both directory names as they were created, for example `testdir` and `TESTDIR`, because directory names are case-sensitive.
* SMB clients use the 8.3 names to distinguish between the two directories. One directory has the base file name. Additional directories are assigned an 8.3 file name.
 ** On SMB clients, you see `testdir` and `TESTDI~1`.
 ** ONTAP creates the `TESTDI~1` directory name to differentiate the two directories.
+
In this case, you must use the 8.3 name when specifying a share path while creating or modifying a share on a storage virtual machine (SVM).

Similarly for files, if an SMB client creates `test.txt`, both SMB and NFS clients display the file name as `text.txt`. However, if an SMB user later tries to create `Test.txt`, the name is not allowed because, to the SMB client, that name currently exists. If an NFS user later creates a file named `Test.txt`, NFS and SMB clients display the file name differently, as follows:

* On NFS clients, you see both file names as they were created, `test.txt` and `Test.txt`, because file names are case-sensitive.
* SMB clients use the 8.3 names to distinguish between the two files. One file has the base file name. Additional files are assigned an 8.3 file name.
 ** On SMB clients, you see `test.txt` and `TEST~1.TXT`.
 ** ONTAP creates the `TEST~1.TXT` file name to differentiate the two files.

[NOTE]
====
If a character mapping has been created using the Vserver CIFS character-mapping commands, a Windows lookup that would normally be case-insensitive can become case-sensitive. This means that filename lookups will only be case-sensitive if the character mapping has been created and the filename is using that character mapping.
