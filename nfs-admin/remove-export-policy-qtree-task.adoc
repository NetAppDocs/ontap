If you decide you do not want a specific export policy assigned to a qtree any longer, you can remove the export policy by modifying the qtree to inherit the export policy of the containing volume instead. You can do this by using the `volume qtree modify` command with the `-export-policy` parameter and an empty name string ("").

.Steps

. To remove an export policy from a qtree, enter the following command:
+
`volume qtree modify -vserver vserver_name -qtree-path /vol/volume_name/qtree_name -export-policy ""`
. Verify that the qtree was modified accordingly:
+
`volume qtree show -qtree qtree_name -fields export-policy`
