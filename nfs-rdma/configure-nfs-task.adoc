[.lead]
In most cases, you do not need to modify the configuration of the NFS-enabled storage VM for NFS over RDMA. 

If you are, however, dealing with issues related to Mellanox chips and LIF migration, you should increase the NFSv4 locking grace period. By default, the grace period is set to 45 seconds. Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, the grace period has a maximum value of 180 (seconds).

.Steps
. Set the privilege level to advanced:
+
`set -privilege advanced`
+
. Enter the following command:
+
`vserver nfs modify -vserver _SVM_name_ -v4-grace-seconds _number_of_seconds_`
