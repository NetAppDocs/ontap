= Configure LIFs for NFS over RDMA

[.lead]
To use NFS over RDMA, you must configure your LIFs (network interface) to be RDMA compatible. Both the LIF and its failover pair must be capable of supporting RDMA.

== Create a new LIF

.System Manager
--
You must be running ONTAP 9.12.1 or later to create a network interface for NFS over RDMA with System Manager. 

.Steps 
. Select *Network > Overview > Network Interfaces*.
. Select image:icon_add.gif[Add icon].
. When you select *NFS,SMB/CIFS,S3*, you have the option to *Use RoCE ports*. Select the checkbox for *Use RoCE ports*.
. Select the storage VM and home node. Assign a **Name**, **IP address**, and **Subnet mask**. 
. Once you enter the IP address and subnet mask, System Manager filters the list of broadcast domains to those that have RoCE capable ports. Select a broadcast domain. You can optionally add a gateway.
. Select *Save*.

.Steps
. Create a LIF:
+
`network interface create -vserver _SVM_name_ -lif _lif_name_ -service-policy _service_policy_name_ -home-node _node_name_ -home-port _port_name_ {-address _IP_address_ -netmask _netmask_value_ | -subnet-name _subnet_name_} -firewall-policy _policy_name_ -auto-revert {true|false} -rdma-protocols roce`
+
* The service policy must be either default-data-files or a custom policy that includes the data-nfs network interface service.
+

* The `-rdma-protocols` parameter accepts a list, which is by default empty. When `roce` is added as a value, the LIF can only be configured on ports supporting RoCE offload, affecting bot LIF migration and failover.

== Modify a LIF

.System Manager
--
You must be running ONTAP 9.12.1 or later to create a network interface for NFS over RDMA with System Manager. 

.Steps
. Select *Network > Overview > Network Interfaces*.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon] *> Edit* beside the network interface you want to change.
. Check *Use RoCE Ports* to enable NFS over RDMA or uncheck the box to disable it. If the network interface is on a RoCE capable port, you will see a checkbox next to *Use RoCE ports*. 
. Modify the other settings as needed.
. Select *Save* to confirm your changes. 
--

.CLI
--
. You can check the status of your LIFs with the `network interface show` command. The service policy must include the data-nfs network interface service. The `-rdma-protocols` list should include `roce`. If either of these conditions are untrue, modify the LIF.
+
Learn more about `network interface show` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/network-interface-show.html[ONTAP command reference^].
. To modify the LIF, run:
+
`network interface modify vserver _SVM_name_ -lif _lif_name_ -service-policy _service_policy_name_ -home-node _node_name_ -home-port _port_name_ {-address _IP_address_ -netmask _netmask_value_ | -subnet-name _subnet_name_} -firewall-policy _policy_name_ -auto-revert {true|false} -rdma-protocols roce`
+
Learn more about `network interface modify` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/network-interface-modify.html[ONTAP command reference^].

[NOTE]
Modifying a LIF to require a particular offload protocol when the LIF is not currently assigned to a port that supports that protocol will produce an error.

== Migrate a LIF

ONTAP also allows you to migrate network interfaces (LIFs) to use NFS over RDMA. When performing this migration, you must ensure the destination port is RoCE capable. Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, you can complete this procedure in System Manager. When selecting a destination port for the network interface, System Manager will designate whether ports are RoCE capable. 

You can only migrate a LIF to an NFS over RDMA configuration if:

* It is an NFS RDMA network interface (LIF) hosted on a RoCE capable port.
* It is an NFS TCP network interface (LIF) hosted on a RoCE capable port.
* It is an NFS TCP network interface (LIF) hosted on a non-RoCE capable port.

For more information about migrating a network interface, refer to xref:../networking/migrate_a_lif.html[Migrate a LIF].
