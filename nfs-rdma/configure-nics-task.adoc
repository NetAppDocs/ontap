NFS over RDMA requires NIC configuration for both the client system and storage platform. 

== Storage platform configuration

An X1148 RDMA adapter needs to be installed on the server. If you are using an HA configuration, you must have a corresponding X1148 adapter on the failover partner so RDMA service can continue during failover. The NIC must be ROCE capable. 

Beginning in ONTAP 9.10.1, you can view a list of RDMA offload protocols with the command:
`network port show -rdma-protocols roce`

== Client system configuration

Clients must be using Mellanox RDMA-capable NIC cards (e.g. X1148) and Mellanox OFED network software. Consult Mellanox documentation for supported models and versions. Although the client and server can be directly connected, the use of switches is recommended due to improved failover performance with a switch.

The client, server, and any switches, and all ports on switches must be configured using Jumbo frames. Also ensure that priority flow-control is in effect on any switches. 

Once this configuration is confirmed, you can mount the NFS. 

.Steps 
. Check if RDMA access is enabled on the NFS server with the command:
+
`vserver nfs show-vserver _vserver_name_`
+
By default, `-rdma` should be enabled. If it is not, enable RDMA access on the NFS server:
+
`vserver nfs modify -vserver _vserver_name_ -rdma enabled`
. Mount the client via NFSv4.0 over RDMA:
.. The input for the proto parameter depends on the server IP protocol version. If it is v4, use `proto=rdma`. If it is v6, use `proto=rdma6`. 
.. Specify the NFS target port as `port=20049` instead of the standard port of 2049:
+
`mount -o vers=4,minorversion=0,proto=rdma,port=20049 _Server_IP_address_:/_volume_path_ _mount_point_`
. *OPTIONAL*: If you need to unmount the client, run the command `unmount _mount_path_`
