== Data protection 

[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| Update | Description 
| xref:../snaplock/set-retention-period-task.html[Set SnapLock retention period up to 100 years]
| In releases earlier than ONTAP 9.10.1, the maximum supported retention time is January 19, 2071. Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1 SnapLock Enterprise and Compliance support a retention time up to October 26, 3058 and a retention period up to 100 years. Older policies are automatically converted when you extend retention dates.
| xref:../snaplock/set-retention-period-task.html[Ability to create SnapLock and non-SnapLock volumes on the same aggregate] | Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, SnapLock and non-SnapLock volumes can exist on the same aggregate, so it is no longer necessary to create a separate SnapLock aggregate for SnapLock volumes.
| xref:../consistency-groups/index.html[Consistency groups] | Organize volumes and LUNs in consistency groups to manage data protection policies and ensure write-order fidelity of workloads spanning multiple storage volumes.
| xref:../concepts/snapmirror-cloud-backups-object-store-concept.html[Archive backups with the public cloud] | SnapMirror Cloud supports tiering of ONTAP backups to lower cost public cloud object storage classes in AWS and MS Azure for long-term retention.
| xref:../authentication/enable-ad-users-groups-access-cluster-svm-task.html[AES support for secure Netlogon channel communication] | If you connect to Windows domain controllers using the Netlogon authentication service, you can use Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for secure channel communications.
| xref:../authentication/configure-authentication-tunnel-task.html[Kerberos for SMB domain-tunnel authentication] | Kerberos authentication is available for domain tunnel authentications for ONTAP management in addition to NTLM. This allows for more secure logins to the ONTAP CLI and System Manager GUI using Active Directory credentials.
| xref:../nfs-config/using-ldap-concept.html[Channel binding for increased LDAP communication security] | LDAP channel binding is supported by default for both Active Directory and name services LDAP connections. This provides better protection against man-in-the-middle attacks.

|===
| Update | Description 
| xref:../nfs-rdma/index.html[NFS over RDMA (NVIDIA only)] | NFS over RDMA utilizes RDMA adapters, allowing data to be copied directly between storage system memory and host system memory, circumventing CPU interruptions and overhead. NFS over RDMA enables the use of NVIDIA GPUDirect Storage for GPU-accelerated workloads on hosts with supported NVIDIA GPUs.

== MetroCluster 

[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| Update | Description 
| link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/install-ip/task_modify_ip_netmask_gateway_properties.html[Configuration of layer 3 MetroCluster IP address in MetroCluster IP configurations] | You can edit the MetroCluster IP address, netmask, and gateway for nodes in a layer 3 configuration.
