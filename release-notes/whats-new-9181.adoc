| Update | Description
a|
xref:../nvme/support-limitations.html#features[SnapMirror active sync support for host access over NVMe]
a|
SnapMirror active sync adds support for NVMe access for VMware workloads with  NVMe/TCP and NVMe/FC host access for two-node ONTAP clusters. VMware workload support for NVMe/TCP is contingent on VMware bugs being addressed.

xref:../snapmirror-active-sync/index.html[ONTAP Cloud Mediator support with SnapMirror active sync]
a|
ONTAP Cloud Mediator is introduced in ONTAP 9.17.1 and supports SnapMirror active sync relationships. The cloud-based mediator, like ONTAP Mediator, acts as the quorum witness for SnapMirror active sync relationships, ensuring transparent failover while reducing the operational complexity of maintaining and managing a third site.

== Networking

[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]

| Update | Description 
a| 
xref:../networking/ipsec-prepare.html[IPsec hardware offload IPv6 support] 
a| 
Beginning with ONTAP 9.18.1, IPsec hardware offload support is extended to IPv6. 
a|
xref:../networking/configure_network_security_using_federal_information_processing_standards_fips.html[OpenSSL PQC algorithms] 
a| 
Beginning with ONTAP 9.18.1, ONTAP supports postquantum computing cryptographic algorithms for SSL. These algorithms provide additional protection against potential future quantum computing attacks, and are available when SSL FIPS mode is disabled. 
a|
xref:../networking/configure-backend-encryption.html[ONTAP backend cluster network encryption] 
a| 
Beginning with ONTAP 9.18.1, you can enable TLS encryption for data-in-flight on the ONTAP backend cluster network. 
a|
xref:../high-availability/ha-pair-encryption.html[ONTAP HA traffic network encryption] 
a| 
Beginning with ONTAP 9.18.1, you can enable encryption for traffic between high-availability (HA) pairs.

== SAN 

[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]

| Update | Description 
a|
xref:../san-admin/nvme-copy-offload.html[NVMe copy offload]
a|
NVMe copy offload enables an NVMe host to offload copy operations from its CPU to the CPU of the ONTAP storage controller.  The host can copy data from one NVMe namespace to another while reserving its CPU resources for application workloads.

| Update | Description
a|
xref:../s3-snapshots/list-restore-s3-snapshot.html#restore-content-from-s3-snapshots[Support for point-in-time S3 snapshot restore]
a|
Provides the ability to restore corrupted objects in an S3 bucket, or restore the entire bucket over an existing bucket.

| Update | Description 
a|
xref:../anti-ransomware/use-cases-restrictions-concept.html#supported-configurations[FlexGroup volume support for ARP/AI]
a|
Beginning with ONTAP 9.18.1, NetApp FlexGroup volumes support ARP/AI, providing advanced, machine-learning-based ransomware detection and protection.  In ONTAP 9.17.1 and earlier, only the first generation of ARP was available for FlexGroup volumes. Beginning with ONTAP 9.18.1, FlexGroup volumes have parity with FlexVol volumes on both on-premises ONTAP platforms (AFF and FAS) and virtual ONTAP deployments (including Cloud Volumes ONTAP and ONTAP Select). As a result, ARP/AI becomes the default ARP technology for both FlexVol and FlexGroup volumes.

== Storage resource management enhancements  

[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| Update | Description 
a|
xref:../performance-admin/adaptive-qos-policy-groups-task.html[Support for two-level nested QoS policy groups on SVMs and volumes]
a|
You can assign a QoS policy to an SVM and to volumes under the SVM at the same time. 

//ONTAPDOC-3272
a| 
xref:../flexcache/create-volume-task.html[Support for creating FlexCache volumes for SVMs that belong to an SVM-DR relationship] 
a|

You can create SVM FlexCache volumes of origin volumes that are part of an SVM-DR relationship.
