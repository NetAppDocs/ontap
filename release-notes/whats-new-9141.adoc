| Update | Description 
| xref:../encryption-at-rest/configure-netapp-volume-encryption-concept.html[NVE supported on SVM root volumes] | SVM root volumes can be encrypted using unique keys with NetApp Volume Encryption.
| xref:../snaplock/snapshot-lock-concept.html[Ability to set snapshot locking on long-term retention snapshots ] and xref:../snaplock/initialize-complianceclock-task.html[to reinitialize the Compliance Clock] | On clusters with a SnapLock license, tamperproof snapshot locking for snapshots with long-term retention can be set for snapshots created on non-SnapLock SnapMirror destination volumes and the Compliance Clock can be initialized when no SnapLock volumes are present.
| xref:../snapmirror-active-sync/index.html[SnapMirror active sync supports SCIS3 persistent reservations and Windows Failover Clustering] | SCSI3 persistent reservations and Window Failover Clustering for SnapMirror active sync supports multiple nodes accessing a device while at the same time blocking access to other nodes, ensuring clustering for different application environments stays consistent and stable. 
| xref:../data-protection/snapmirror-svm-replication-concept.html[Copy volume-granular snapshots with consistency groups] | You can utilize consistency groups to replicate Asynchronous SnapMirror snapshots and volume-granular snapshots to the destination consistency groups for an extra layer of disaster recovery.
| xref:../task_dp_configure_storage_vm_dr.html[Asynchronous data protection support for consistency groups within SVM disaster recovery relationship] | SVMs configured for SVM disaster recovery can replicate consistency group information to the secondary site if the SVM contains a consistency group.
| link:https://hwu.netapp.com/[SnapMirror asynchronous support for 20 fanout targets^] | The number of SnapMirror asynchronous fanout targets supported on A700 and higher systems increases from 16 to 20 when using ONTAP 9.14.1.
| xref:../flexcache/create-volume-task.html[Unencrypted cache creation from encrypted source] | Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.0, FlexCache supports creating an unencrypted FlexCache volume from an encrypted source.

== S3 object storage 

[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| Update | Description 
| xref:../s3-config/create-bucket-task.html[Automatic resizing has been enabled on S3 FlexGroup volumes to eliminate excessive capacity allocation when buckets are created on them] | When buckets are created on or deleted from new or existing FlexGroup volumes, the volumes are resized to a minimum required size. The minimum required size is the total size of all the S3 buckets in a FlexGroup volume.
| xref:../s3-config/index.html[S3 object storage support on mirrored and unmirrored aggregates] | You can enable an S3 object storage server on an SVM in a mirrored or unmirrored aggregate in MetroCluster IP and FC configurations.
| xref:../s3-config/ontap-s3-supported-actions-reference.html[Object locking based on users roles and lock retention period] | Objects in S3 buckets can be locked from being overwritten or deleted. The ability to lock objects is based on specific users or time.
| xref:../s3-config/configure-access-ldap.html[Configuring access for LDAP user groups to support external directory services and adding validity period for access and secret keys]
a| ONTAP administrators can configure access for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) or Active Directory user groups to ONTAP S3 object storage, with the ability to enable authentication in LDAP fast bind mode. Users in local or domain groups or LDAP groups can generate their own access and secret keys for S3 clients.
You can define a validity period for the access keys and secret keys of S3 users.
ONTAP provides support for variables such as `$aws:username` for bucket policies and group policies.

== SAN 

[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| Update | Description 
| xref:../nvme/manage-automated-discovery.html[NVMe/TCP automated host discovery] | Host discovery of controllers using the NVMe/TCP protocol is automated by default.
| xref:../nvme/disable-vmid-task.html[NVMe/FC host side reporting and troubleshooting] | By default, ONTAP supports the ability of NVMe/FC hosts to identify virtual machines by a unique identifier and for NVMe/FC hosts to monitor virtual machine resource utilization. This enhances host-side reporting and troubleshooting.
| xref:../san-admin/map-nvme-namespace-subsystem-task.html[NVMe host prioritization] | You can configure your NVMe subsystem to prioritize resource allocation for specific hosts. Host assigned a high priority are allocated larger I/O queue counts and larger queue depths.
|===

== Security  

[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| Update | Description 
| xref:../authentication/configure-cisco-duo-mfa-task.html[Support for Cisco DUO multifactor authentication for SSH users] | SSH users can authenticate using Cisco DUO as a second factor of authentication during sign-in.
| link:../authentication/oauth2-deploy-ontap.html[Enhancements to OAuth 2.0 support] | ONTAP 9.14.1 extends the core token-based authentication and OAuth 2.0 support initially provided with ONTAP 9.14.0. Authorization can be configured using Active Directory or LDAP with group-to-role mapping. Sender-constrained access tokens are also supported and secured based on Mutual TLS (mTLS). In addition to Auth0 and Keycloak, Microsoft Windows Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS) is supported as an Identity Provider (IdP).
|link:../authentication/oauth2-deploy-ontap.html[OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework] | The Open Authorization (OAuth 2.0) framework is added and provides token-based authentication for ONTAP REST API clients. This enables more secure management and administration of the ONTAP clusters using automation workflows powered by REST API scripts or Ansible. The standard OAuth 2.0 features are supported, including issuer, audience, local validation, remote introspection, remote user claim, and proxy support. Client authorization can be configured using self-contained OAuth 2.0 scopes or by mapping the local ONTAP users. Supported Identity Providers (IdP) include Auth0 and Keycloak using multiple concurrent servers.
| xref:../anti-ransomware/manage-parameters-task.html[Tunable alerts for Autonomous Ransomware Protection] | Configure Autonomous Ransomware Protection to receive notifications whenever a new file extension is detected or when an ARP snapshot is taken, receiving earlier warning to possible ransomware events.
| xref:../nas-audit/persistent-stores.html[FPolicy supports persistent stores to reduce latency] | FPolicy allows you to set up a persistent store to capture file access events for asynchronous non-mandatory policies in the SVM. Persistent stores can help decouple client I/O processing from the FPolicy notification processing to reduce client latency. Synchronous and asynchronous mandatory configurations are not supported.
| xref:../flexcache/supported-unsupported-features-concept.html[FPolicy supports FlexCache volumes on SMB] | FPolicy is supported for FlexCache volumes with NFS or SMB. Previously, FPolicy was not supported for FlexCache volumes with SMB.

== Storage efficiency  

[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| Update | Description 
| xref:../file-system-analytics/considerations-concept.html[Scan tracking in File System Analytics] | Track the File System Analytics initialization scan with real time insights about progress and throttling.
| xref:../volumes/determine-space-usage-volume-aggregate-concept.html[Increase in usable aggregate space on FAS platforms] | For FAS platforms, the WAFL reserve for aggregates greater than 30TB in size is reduced from 10% to 5%, resulting in increased usable space in the aggregate.
| xref:../volumes/determine-space-usage-volume-aggregate-concept.html[Change in reporting of physical used space in TSSE volumes]
a| On volumes with temperature-sensitive storage efficiency (TSSE) enabled, the ONTAP CLI metric for reporting the amount of space used in the volume includes the space savings realized as a result of TSSE. This metric is reflected in the volume show -physical-used and the volume show-space -physical used commands.
For FabricPool, the value of `-physical-used` is a combination of the capacity tier and the performance tier.
For specific commands, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli-9141/volume-show.html[`volume show`^] and link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli-9141/volume-show-space.html[`volume show space`^].
