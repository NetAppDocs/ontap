| xref:../nvme/disable-vmid-task.html[NVMe/FC host side reporting and troubleshooting] | By default, ONTAP supports the ability of NVMe/FC hosts to identify virtual machines by a unique identifier and for NVMe/FC hosts to monitor virtual machine resource utilization. This enhances host-side reporting and troubleshooting.
| xref:../san-admin/map-nvme-namespace-subsystem-task.html[NVMe host prioritization] | You can configure your NVMe subsystem to prioritize resource allocation for specific hosts. Host assigned a high priority are allocated larger I/O queue counts and larger queue depths.

== Security  

[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| Update | Description 
| xref:../authentication/configure-cisco-duo-mfa-task.html[Support for Cisco Duo multifactor authentication for SSH users] | SSH users can authenticate using Cisco DUO as a second factor of authentication during login.
| link:../authentication/oauth2-deploy-ontap.html[Enhancements to OAuth 2.0 support] | ONTAP 9.14.1 extends the core token-based authentication and OAuth 2.0 support initially provided with ONTAP 9.14.0. Authorization can be configured using Active Directory or LDAP with group-to-role mapping. Sender-constrained access tokens are also supported and secured based on Mutual TLS (mTLS). In addition to Auth0 and Keycloak, Microsoft Windows Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS) is supported as an Identity Provider (IdP).
|link:../authentication/oauth2-deploy-ontap.html[OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework] | The Open Authorization (OAuth 2.0) framework is added and provides token-based authentication for ONTAP REST API clients. This enables more secure management and administration of the ONTAP clusters using automation workflows powered by REST API scripts or Ansible. The standard OAuth 2.0 features are supported, including issuer, audience, local validation, remote introspection, remote user claim, and proxy support. Client authorization can be configured using self-contained OAuth 2.0 scopes or by mapping the local ONTAP users. Supported Identity Providers (IdP) include Auth0 and Keycloak using multiple concurrent servers.
| xref:../anti-ransomware/manage-parameters-task.html[Tunable alerts for Autonomous Ransomware Protection] | Configure Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP) to receive notifications whenever a new file extension is detected or when an ARP Snapshot is taken, receiving earlier warning to possible ransomware events.

Persistent stores can help decouple client I/O processing from the FPolicy notification processing to reduce client latency. Synchronous and asynchronous mandatory configurations are not supported.
| xref:../flexcache/supported-unsupported-features-concept.html[FPolicy supports FlexCache volumes on SMB] | FPolicy is supported for FlexCache volumes with NFS or SMB. Previously, FPolicy was not supported for FlexCache volumes with SMB.

|===
| Update | Description 
| xref:../file-system-analytics/considerations-concept.html[Scan tracking in File System Analytics] | Track the File System Analytics initialization scan with real time insights about progress and throttling.
| xref:../volumes/determine-space-usage-volume-aggregate-concept.html[Increase in usable aggregate space on FAS platforms] | For FAS platforms, the WAFL reserve for aggregates greater than 30TB in size is reduced from 10% to 5%, resulting in increased usable space in the aggregate.
| xref:../volumes/determine-space-usage-volume-aggregate-concept.html[Change in reporting of physical used space in TSSE volumes]
a| On volumes with temperature-sensitive storage efficiency (TSSE) enabled, the ONTAP CLI metric for reporting the amount of space used in the volume includes the space savings realized as a result of TSSE. This metric is reflected in the volume show -physical-used and the volume show-space -physical used commands.
For FabricPool, the value of `-physical-used` is a combination of the capacity tier and the performance tier.
For specific commands, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli-9141/volume-show.html[`volume show`^] and link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli-9141/volume-show-space.html[`volume show space`^].
| xref:../flexgroup/manage-flexgroup-rebalance-task.html[Proactive FlexGroup rebalancing] | FlexGroup volumes provide support for automatically moving growing files in a directory to a remote constituent to reduce I/O bottlenecks on the local constituent.
| xref:../flexgroup/supported-unsupported-config-concept.html[Snapshot copy tagging in FlexGroup volumes] | You can add, modify, and delete tags and labels (comments) in to help identify Snapshot copies and to help avoid accidentally deleting Snapshot copies in FlexGroup volumes.
| xref:../fabricpool/enable-disable-volume-cloud-write-task.html[Write directly to the cloud with FabricPool] | FabricPool adds the ability to write data to a volume in FabricPool so it goes directly to the cloud without waiting for the tiering scan.
| xref:../fabricpool/enable-disable-aggressive-read-ahead-task.html[Aggressive read-ahead with FabricPool] | FabricPool provides aggressive read-ahead of files such as movie streams on FabricPool volumes to ensure that no frames are dropped.
| xref:../svm-migrate/index.html#supported-and-unsupported-features[SVM data mobility support for migrating SVMs containing user and group quotas and qtrees] | SVM data mobility adds support for migrating SVMs containing user and group quotas and qtrees.
| xref:../svm-migrate/index.html[Support for a maximum of 400 volumes per SVM, a maximum of 12 HA pairs, and pNFS with NFS 4.1 using SVM data mobility] | The maximum number of supported volumes per SVM with SVM data mobility increases to 400 and the number of supported HA pairs increases to 12.

| xref:../consistency-groups/index.html[Enhanced support for consistency group monitoring] | System Manager displays historical data about consistency group usage.
| xref:../nvme/setting-up-secure-authentication-nvme-tcp-task.html[NVMe in-band authentication] | You can use System Manager to configure secure, unidirectional and bidirectional authentication between an NVMe host and controller over the NVMe/TCP and NVMe/FC protocols using the DH-HMAC-CHAP authentication protocol.
