Learn about some of the changes to limits and defaults implemented in ONTAP 9 releases. NetApp strives to help its customers understand the most important default and limit changes in each ONTAP release.

== Changes to ONTAP defaults
Before you upgrade to a new ONTAP release, you should be aware of any changes to ONTAP default settings that might affect your automation or business operations.

|===
| Feature | Default change | Changed in release…
| NAS audit
| The maximum limits for `file-session-io-grouping-count` and `file-session-io-grouping-duration` parameters have increased so that you can optionally select fewer, more consolidated NAS audit event notifications. This benefits SVMs with high rates of IO, reducing the storage impact on the destination volume.
 
NFS_FILE_SESSION_IO_GROUPING_COUNT_MAX: 20000 to 120000
NFS_FILE_SESSION_IO_GROUPING_DURATION_MAX: 600 to 3600
| ONTAP 9.16.1

//ONTAPDOC-2501
| Maximum volumes per node for FAS systems
| For FAS systems with greater than 200GB RAM per controller, the maximum supported number of volumes per node increases from 1000 to 2500. In earlier versions of ONTAP, a link:../data-protection/dpo-systems-feature-enhancements-reference.html[Data Protection Optimized (DPO)] license was needed to increase ONTAP FAS system support from 1000 to 2500 volumes per node.
| ONTAP 9.16.1
//ONTAPDOC-2199 and ONTAPDOC-2200

| `vserver object-store-server user show` command
| In releases prior to ONTAP 9.15.1, the `vserver object-store-server user show` command would return the S3 user's secret keys. The command will no longer return secret key data for S3 users.
| ONTAP 9.15.1

| NAS audit
| NAS audit configuration allows retaining all audit log records by default. A revised value for the rotate-limit parameter ensures the audit log is sized properly for the volume supporting it.
| ONTAP 9.15.1

| Space allocation
| Space allocation is enabled by default for newly created LUNs. Space allocation had been disabled by default in previous versions of ONTAP (9.14.1 and earlier).
| ONTAP 9.15.1

| NVMe/TCP automated host discovery
| Host discovery of controllers using the NVMe/TCP protocol is automated by default.
| ONTAP 9.14.1

| AES encryption for Kerberos-based communication
| AES encryption for authentication is enabled by default for Kerberos-based communication with SMB servers. You can disable AES encryption manually if your environment does not support it.
| ONTAP 9.13.1

| RAID aggregate
| Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, the system controller will not shut down by default after 24 hours if any aggregate is degraded. If a user changes the `raid.timeout` option, the system controller will continue to shut down after the expiration of `raid.timeout` hours.
| ONTAP 9.12.1

| TLS 1.1 disabled by default
| TLS 1.1 is disabled by default for new installations of ONTAP. Systems that are upgraded to ONTAP 9.12.0 and later that already have TLS 1.1 enabled  are not affected as the upgrade will leave TLS 1.1 in an enabled state. However, if you're upgrading clusters with FIPS enabled, TLS 1.1 is not supported with FIPS beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, thus TLS 1.1 will automatically be disabled. When disabled by default, TLS 1.1 can be manually enabled as needed.
| ONTAP 9.12.0 
 
| TLS 1.0 disabled by default
| TLS 1.0 is disabled by default for new installations of ONTAP. Systems that are upgraded to ONTAP 9.8 and later that already have TLS 1.0 enabled are not affected as the upgrade will leave TLS 1.0 in an enabled state. However, if you're upgrading clusters with FIPS enabled, TLS 1.0 is not supported with FIPS beginning with ONTAP 9.8, thus TLS 1.0 will automatically be disabled. When disabled by default, TLS 1.0 can be manually enabled as needed.
| ONTAP 9.8
