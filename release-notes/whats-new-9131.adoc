| xref:../concepts/rdma-concept.html[Expanded hardware support for RDMA cluster interconnect] | ONTAP supports AFF A900, ASA A900, and FAS9500 systems for cluster interconnect RDMA with an X91153A cluster NIC, helping to reduce latency, decrease failover times, and accelerate communication between nodes.
| Increased data LIF limits | ONTAP provides greater flexibility by increasing data LIF scaling limits for both HA pairs and clusters.
| IPv6 support during cluster setup on the A800 and FAS8700 platforms
| On the A800 and FAS8700 platforms, you can use the ONTAP CLI to create and configure new clusters in IPv6-only networking environments.

== Security  

[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| Feature | Description 
| xref:../anti-ransomware/index.html[Autonomous Ransomware Protection]
a|
* xref:../anti-ransomware/use-cases-restrictions-concept.html#multi-admin-verification-with-volumes-protected-with-arp[Multi-admin verify functionality with Autonomous Ransomware Protection]
* xref:../anti-ransomware/enable-default-task.html[Automatic transition from learning to active mode]
* xref:../anti-ransomware/use-cases-restrictions-concept.html#supported-configurations[FlexGroup support], including analytics and reporting for FlexGroup volumes and operations inlcuding expanding a FlexGroup volume, FlexVol to FlexGroup conversions, FlexGroup rebalancing. 
| xref:../authentication/grant-access-active-directory-users-groups-task.html[SSH public key authentication with Active Directory] | You can use an SSH public key as your primary authentication method with an Active Directory (AD) user, or you can use an SSH public key as your secondary authentication method after an AD user.
| X.509 certificates with SSH public keys | ONTAP enables you to associate an X.509 certificate with the SSH public key for an account, giving you the added security of certificate expiration and revocation checks upon SSH login.
| xref:../nas-audit/create-fpolicy-event-task.html[FPolicy file access failure notification]
| FPolicy supports notifications for access denied events. Notifications are generated for file operation failed due to lack of permission, which includes: failure due to NTFS permissions, failure due to Unix mode bits, and failure due to NFSv4 ACLs.
| xref:../authentication/setup-ssh-multifactor-authentication-task.html#enable-mfa-with-totp[Multifactor authentication with TOTP (time-based one-time passwords)]

== Storage efficiency  

[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| Update | Description 
| Change in reporting of primary data reduction ratio in System Manager
a| The primary data reduction ratio displayed in System Manager no longer includes Snapshot copy space savings in the calculation. It only depicts the ratio between used logical and used physical space. In prior releases of ONTAP, the primary data reduction ratio included significant space reduction benefits of Snapshot copies.
As a result, when you upgrade to ONTAP 9.13.1, you will observe a significantly lower primary ratio being reported. You can still see data reduction ratios with Snapshot copies in the **Capacity** details view.
| xref:../volumes/enable-temperature-sensitive-efficiency-concept.html[Temperature-sensitive storage efficiency]
| Temperature-sensitive storage efficiency adds sequential packing of contiguous physical blocks to improve storage efficiency. Volumes that have temperature-sensitive storage efficiency enabled will automatically have sequential packing enabled when systems are upgraded to ONTAP 9.13.1.
| Logical space enforcement
| Logical space enforcement is supported on SnapMirror destinations.
| xref:../volumes/manage-svm-capacity.html[Storage VM capacity limits support]
| You can set capacity limits on a storage VM (SVM) and enable alerts when the SVM is approaching a percentage threshold.
|===

== Storage resource management enhancements  

[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| Update | Description 
| Increase in maximum number of inodes | ONTAP will continue to automatically add inodes (at the rate of 1 inode per 32 KB of volume space) even if the volume grows larger than 680 GB. ONTAP will continue adding inodes until it reaches the maximum of 2,147,483,632.
| xref:../volumes/create-flexclone-task.html#create-a-flexclone-volume-of-a-flexvol-or-flexgroup[Support for specifying a SnapLock type during FlexClone creation] | You can specify one of three SnapLock types, either compliance, enterprise, or non-SnapLock, when creating a FlexClone of a read/write volume.
| xref:..//task_nas_file_system_analytics_enable.html#modify[Enable File System Analytics by default] | Set File System Analytics to be enabled by default on new volumes.
| xref:../flexgroup/create-svm-disaster-recovery-relationship-task.html[SVM disaster recovery fanout relationships with FlexGroup volumes]
a| The fanout restriction of SVM DR with FlexGroup volumes is removed.
SVM DR with FlexGroup includes support for SnapMirror fanout relationships to eight sites.
| xref:../flexgroup/manage-flexgroup-rebalance-task.html[Single FlexGroup rebalancing operation] | You can schedule a single FlexGroup rebalancing operation to begin at a date and time in the future that you specify.
| xref:../fabricpool/benefits-storage-tiers-concept.html[FabricPool read performance] | FabricPool provides improved sequential read performance for single and multi-stream workloads for cloud-resident data and tiering throughput. This improvement can send a higher rate of GETs and PUTs to the back end object store. If you have on-premises object stores, you should consider performance headroom on the object store service and determine whether you might need to throttle FabricPool PUTs.
| xref:../performance-admin/guarantee-throughput-qos-task.html[Adaptive QoS policy templates] | Adaptive QoS policy templates enable you to set throughput floors at the SVM level.

a| The primary data reduction ratio displayed in System Manager no longer includes Snapshot copy space savings in the calculation. It only depicts the ratio between used logical and used physical space. In prior releases of ONTAP, the primary data reduction ratio included significant space reduction benefits of Snapshot copies.
As a result, when you upgrade to ONTAP 9.13.1, you will observe a significantly lower primary ratio being reported. You can still see data reduction ratios with Snapshot copies in the Capacity details view.

System Manager users can view visual depictions of additional hardware platforms in the "Hardware" page, including ASA platforms and AFF C-Series platforms.
Support for AFF C-Series platforms is also included in the latest patch releases of ONTAP 9.12.1, ONTAP 9.11.1, and ONTAP 9.10.1.
The visualizations identify problems or concerns with platforms, providing a quick method for users to troubleshoot hardware problems.
