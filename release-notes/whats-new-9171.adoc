IPsec hardware offload with link aggregation groups and postquantum preshared keys support
a|
ONTAP supports IPsec hardware offload for link aggregation groups, extending the hardware offload support introduced in 9.16.1. ONTAP also supports postquantum preshared keys for IPsec to protect against potential future quantum computer attacks.

//ONTAPDOC-2724
a|
OpenStack Barbican key manager support

//ONTAPDOC-2717

Just in time (JIT) privilege elevation support
a|
ONTAP supports JIT privilege elevation for role-based access control (RBAC). Administrators can request temporary elevation to a configured role, allowing access to privileged commands on an on-demand basis. Cluster administrators can configure who can access JIT privilege elevation and when and for how long access is allowed.

//ONTAPDOC-2714
a|
Support for Entra IdP and IdP group support for SAML authentication
a|
ONTAP supports Microsoft Entra as a SAML identity provider. Additionally, IdP-provided group information can be mapped to ONTAP roles.

//ONTAPDOC-2711
a|
Auditing of cross-cluster requests
a|
You can configure and run audit operations on both the initiating source cluster and destination (executing) cluster. In previous releases, only the cluster receiving the client’s request performed auditing. With this feature, a peered cluster that fulfills a cross‑cluster request also logs the activity. These auditing operations can be enabled and extended to any SET or GET request initiated within ONTAP.
