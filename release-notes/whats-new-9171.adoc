| Update | Description
a|
xref:../nvme/support-limitations.html#features[SnapMirror active sync support for host access over NVMe]
a|
SnapMirror active sync adds support for NVMe access for VMware workloads with  NVMe/TCP and NVMe/FC host access for two-node ONTAP clusters. VMware workload support for NVMe/TCP is contingent on VMware bugs being addressed.

//ONTAPDOC-2727

xref:../snapmirror-active-sync/index.html[ONTAP Cloud Mediator support with SnapMirror active sync]
a|
ONTAP Cloud Mediator is introduced in ONTAP 9.17.1 and supports SnapMirror active sync relationships. The cloud-based mediator, like ONTAP Mediator, acts as the quorum witness for SnapMirror active sync relationships, ensuring transparent failover while reducing the operational complexity of maintaining and managing a third site.

== S3 object storage 

[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| Update | Description
a|
xref:../s3-multiprotocol/index.html[ObjectCopy action support in ONTAP S3 NAS buckets]
a|
The ObjectCopy action is supported within ONTAP S3 NAS bucket. 

//ONTAPDOC-2901
a|
xref:../s3-multiprotocol/index.html#object-multipart-upload[Support for linking an S3 NAS bucket to a junction path]
a|
When creating an S3 NAS bucket with the ONTAP CLI, you can choose to link the bucket to the volume instead of the junction path. When you link to the volume, the junction path is automatically updated if the path changes, for example, when a volume is dismounted or mounted.

//ONTAPDOC-2929
a|
xref:../s3-multiprotocol/index.html#object-multipart-upload[S3 multiprotocol support for tagging and metadata]
a|
Tagging and user metadata key/value pairs are supported by the CreateMulipartUpload action with S3 multiprotocol.

== Security  

[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| Update | Description 
a|
xref:../system-admin/use-hsts-task.html[HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) support]
a|
ONTAP supports HTTP Strict Transport Security for web services, enabling enforcement of secure HTTPS communication between a user's browser and ONTAP.

//ONTAPDOC-2932
a|
xref:../networking/ipsec-prepare.html[IPsec hardware offload with link aggregation groups]
a|
ONTAP supports IPsec hardware offload for link aggregation groups, extending the hardware offload support introduced in 9.16.1.  

//ONTAPDOC-2724
a|
xref:../networking/ipsec-prepare.html[IPsec postquantum pre-shared key support]
a|
ONTAP supports postquantum pre-shared keys for IPsec to protect against potential future quantum computer attacks. 
a|
xref:../encryption-at-rest/manage-keys-barbican-task.html[OpenStack Barbican key manager support]
a|
ONTAP supports OpenStack's Barbican key manager for NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE) keys.

//ONTAPDOC-2717
a|
xref:../authentication/configure-jit-elevation-task.html[Just in time (JIT) privilege elevation support]
a|
ONTAP supports JIT privilege elevation for role-based access control (RBAC). Users can request temporary elevation to a configured role, allowing access to privileged commands on an on-demand basis. Cluster administrators can configure who can access JIT privilege elevation and when and for how long access is allowed.

//ONTAPDOC-2714
a|
xref:../system-admin/configure-saml-authentication-task.html[Support for Entra IdP and IdP group support for SAML authentication]
a|
ONTAP supports Microsoft Entra as a SAML identity provider. Additionally, IdP-provided group information can be mapped to ONTAP roles.

//ONTAPDOC-2711
a|
xref:../system-admin/audit-manage-cross-cluster-requests.html[Auditing of cross-cluster requests]
a|
You can configure and run audit operations on both the initiating source cluster and destination (executing) cluster. In previous releases, only the cluster receiving the client's request performed auditing. With this feature, a peered cluster that fulfills a cross-cluster request also logs the activity. These auditing operations can be enabled and extended to any SET or GET request initiated within ONTAP.
//ONTAPDOC-2937
a|
xref:../anti-ransomware/index.html[Support for SAN with Autonomous Ransomware Protection]
a|
ARP supports SAN volumes with encryption-based anomaly detection, introduces new commands for detailed entropy statistics, and unifies ransomware protection messaging in System Manager that had previously focused on NAS. Configurable detection thresholds and more deterministic snapshot retention provide greater flexibility for diverse workloads.

== Storage resource management enhancements  

[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| Update | Description 
a|
xref:../task_nas_file_system_analytics_enable.html[FSA enabled by default for new volumes]
a|
Volumes created on newly created SVMs on ONTAP clusters allocated for NAS protocols have File System Analytics (FSA) enabled by default. FSA is automatically activated as soon as a volume is created, providing immediate analytics capabilities without additional configuration.

//ONTAPDOC-2736
a| 
xref:../flexgroup/fast-directory-delete-asynchronous-task.html[Enhanced support for viewing direct delete progress on FlexGroup volumes] 
a|
The ONTAP CLI command `volume file async-delete show` has been enhanced to include asynchronous delete jobs issued from clients.
