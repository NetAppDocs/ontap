a|
SnapMirror cloud supports fanout relationships from the same source volume or FlexGroup to one or to multiple buckets in different object stores. 

//ONTAPDOC-2566
a|
xref:../data-protection/cloud-backup-with-snapmirror-task.html[Support for SnapMirror cloud backups from a migrated volume]
a|
SnapMirror cloud supports backups of volumes migrated to the cloud using a more efficient synchronization process. The new functionality supports SnapMirror cloud backups from a migrated volume in the cloud to the same destination object store endpoint without the need for performing a re-baseline operation. Both FlexVol and FlexGroup volumes are supported. 

//ONTAPDOC-2317
a|
xref:../encryption-at-rest/migrate-keys-between-key-managers.html[Support for encryption key migration between key managers] 
a|
When you switch from the ONTAP onboard key manager to an external key manager at the cluster level, you can use the ONTAP command line interface (CLI) to easily migrate the encryption keys from one key manager to the other.

== Networking

[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| Update | Description 
a| 
xref:../networking/configure_virtual_ip_vip_lifs.html#set-up-border-gateway-protocol-bgp[MD5 authentication support for BGP peer groups] 
a| 
ONTAP supports MD5 authentication on BGP peer groups to protect BGP sessions. When MD5 is enabled, BGP sessions can only be established and processed among authorized peers, preventing potential disruptions of the session by an unauthorized actor.

//ONTAPDOC-2401
a| 
xref:../networking/ipsec-prepare.html[IPsec hardware offload support]
a| 
IP security (IPsec) is a data-in-motion security option available to protect all the IP traffic between a client and an ONTAP node. The protocol was initially available with ONTAP 9.8 and has been implemented as software only. Beginning with ONTAP 9.16.1, you have the option of offloading certain computationally intensive operations, such as encryption and integrity checks, to a supported network interface controller (NIC) card installed at the storage nodes. Using this hardware offload option can significantly improve the performance and throughput of the network traffic protected by IPsec.

//ONTAPDOC-2338

== S3 object storage 

[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| Update | Description
a|
Support for S3 tags and user-defined metadata in S3 NAS buckets
a|
You can apply https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-tagging.html[tags and metadata^] that comply with AWS S3 specifications to objects in S3 NAS buckets. Applying tags and metadata to S3 objects using S3 clients helps you define lifecycles, back charging, data categories, and custom workflows on data stored as object or files in ONTAP. When integrated with AWS data services such as Bedrock or Athena, tagging and metadata become central to the data processing provided by these services.

NOTE: Support for tags and user-defined metadata in native S3 buckets began in ONTAP 9.9.1.

//ONTAPDOC-2314
a|
xref:../s3-multiprotocol/index.html[Multiprotocol S3 bucket supports multipart upload]
a|
With Multipart upload, you can upload a single object as a set of parts to the S3 multiprotocol bucket.

//ONTAPDOC-2182
a|
xref:../s3-config/cors-integration.html[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support for ONTAP S3 buckets]
a|
Unlock the full potential of your web applications with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). CORS allows seamless interaction between client applications from one domain and resources in another. By integrating CORS support, you can empower your ONTAP S3-based web applications with selective cross-origin access to your resources.

//ONTAPDOC-2323
a|
xref:../s3-snapshots/index.html[ONTAP supports taking snapshots of ONTAP S3 buckets]
a|
You can generate read-only, point-in-time snapshots of your ONTAP S3 buckets. Using the S3 snapshots feature, you can manually create snapshots or automatically generate them through snapshot policies. Additionally, you can view, browse, and delete S3 snapshots, and restore the snapshot content through S3 clients.

== SAN 

[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| Update | Description 
a|
xref:../san-admin/enable-space-allocation.html[NVMe space deallocation enabled by default]
a|
Space deallocation (also called “hole punching” and “unmap”) is enabled for NVMe namespaces by default. Space deallocation allows a host to deallocate unused blocks from namespaces to reclaim space. This greatly improves overall storage efficiency, especially with filesystems that have data high turnover. 

//ONTAPDOC-2210
|===

== Security  

[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| Update | Description 
a|
xref:../multi-admin-verify/index.html#rule-protected-commands[Eligible set of rule-protected commands extended for multi-admin verification] 
a|
Administrators can create multi-admin verification rules to protect consistency groups, including create, delete, and modify operations, create and delete consistency group snapshots, and other commands.

//ONTAPDOC-2249
a|
xref:../anti-ransomware/index.html[Autonomous Ransomware Protection with AI enhancements (ARP/AI)]
a|
ARP has been upgraded with new AI capabilities, allowing it to detect and respond to ransomware attacks with 99% precision and recall. Because the AI is trained on a comprehensive dataset, there is no longer a learning period for ARP running on FlexVol volumes and ARP/AI starts in active mode right away. ARP/AI also comes with an automatic update capability to ensure constant protection and resilience against the latest threats.

NOTE: The ARP/AI feature currently supports only NAS. Although the automatic update capability displays the availability of new security files for deployment in System Manager, these updates are only applicable for NAS workload protection.

//ONTAPDOC-2176/ONTAPDOC-2205
a|
xref:../nvme/set-up-tls-secure-channel-nvme-task.html[Support for in-flight encryption for data traffic sent to and from NVMe storage devices]
a|
ONTAP now supports in-flight encryption for data traffic sent over the network to and from NVMe storage devices.
