== Data protection 

[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| Update | Description 
| xref:../encryption-at-rest/configure-cluster-key-server-task.html[Cluster external key servers] | Clustered external key management servers support is added for NetApp partners who provide a clustered KMIP server solution. This allows primary and secondary KMIP servers to be added preventing duplication of encryption key data. For supported partners, see the link:https://imt.netapp.com/matrix/#welcome[Interoperability Matrix Tool^].
| xref:../task_dp_create_custom_data_protection_policies.html[SnapMirror asynchronous policy in System Manager] 
a| You can use System Manager to add pre-created and custom mirror and vault policies, display legacy policies, and override the transfer schedules defined in a protection policy when protecting volumes and storage VMs. You can also use System Manager to edit your volume and storage VM protection relationships.
[TIP]
If you are running ONTAP 9.8P12 or a later ONTAP 9.8 patch release, have configured SnapMirror using System Manager, and plan to upgrade to ONTAP 9.9.1 or ONTAP 9.10.1 releases, use ONTAP 9.9.1P13 or later and ONTAP 9.10.1P10 or later patch releases for your upgrade.
| xref:../data-protection/restore-contents-volume-snapshot-task.html[SnapMirror Cloud single directory restore] | Enables cluster administers at the admin privilege level to perform a single directory restore operation from a cloud endpoint. The source endpoint UUID must be provided to identify the backup endpoint from which you are restoring. Because multiple backups can use the same `cloud_endpoint_name` as the destination, the UUID associated with the backup must be provided for the restore command. You can use the `snapmirror show` command to obtain the `source_endpoint_uuid`.
| xref:../snapmirror-active-sync/interoperability-reference.html[Enhanced support for SnapMirror active sync]
a|
* SnapMirror active sync supports AIX as a host
* SnapMirror active sync supports single-file SnapRestore, enabling you to restore an individual LUN or normal file in a SnapMirror active sync configuration.
