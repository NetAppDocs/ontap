You need to be aware of certain ONTAP and licensing requirements when creating SQL Server or Hyper-V over SMB solutions for nondisruptive operations on SVMs.

== ONTAP version requirements

* Hyper-V over SMB
+
ONTAP supports nondisruptive operations over SMB shares for Hyper-V running on Windows 2012 or later.

* SQL Server over SMB
+
ONTAP supports nondisruptive operations over SMB shares for SQL Server 2012 or later running on Windows 2012 or later.

For the latest information about supported versions of ONTAP, Windows Server, and SQL Server for nondisruptive operations over SMB shares, see the Interoperability Matrix.

https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^]

== Licensing requirements

The following licenses are required:

* CIFS
* FlexClone (for Hyper-V over SMB only)
+
This license is required if Remote VSS is used for backups. The shadow copy service uses FlexClone to create point-in-time copies of files that are then used when creating a backup.
+
A FlexClone license is optional if you use a backup method that does not use Remote VSS.

The FlexClone license is included in link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/manage-licenses-concept.html#licenses-included-with-ontap-one[ONTAP One]. If you do not have ONTAP One, you should link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/manage-license-task.html[verify that the required licenses are installed], and, if necessary, link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/install-license-task.html[install them].
