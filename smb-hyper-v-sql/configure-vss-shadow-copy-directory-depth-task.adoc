[.lead]
Optionally, you can configure the maximum depth of directories within SMB shares on which to create shadow copies. This parameter is useful if you want to manually control the maximum level of subdirectories on which ONTAP should create shadow copies.

.Before you begin

The VSS shadow copy feature must be enabled.

.About this task

The default is to create shadow copies for a maximum of five subdirectories. If the value is set to `0`, ONTAP creates shadow copies for all subdirectories.

[NOTE]
====
Although you can specify that the shadow copy set directory depth include more than five subdirectories or all subdirectories, there is a Microsoft requirement that shadow copy set creation must be completed within 60 seconds. Shadow copy set creation fails if it cannot be completed within this time. The shadow copy directory depth you choose must not cause the creation time to exceed the time limit.

.Steps

. Set the privilege level to advanced:
+
`*set -privilege advanced*`
. Set the VSS shadow copy directory depth to the desired level:
+
`*vserver cifs options modify -vserver _vserver_name_ -shadowcopy-dir-depth integer*`
+
`*vserver cifs options modify -vserver vs1 -shadowcopy-dir-depth 6*`

. Return to the admin privilege level:
+
`*set -privilege admin*`
