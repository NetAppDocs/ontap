[.lead]
Before you can obtain information about CIFS, SMB, auditing, and BranchCache hash statistics and monitor performance, you must know which objects and counters are available from which you can obtain data.

.Steps

. Set the privilege level to advanced:
+
`set -privilege advanced`
. Perform one of the following actions:
+
[options="header"]
|===
| If you want to determine...| Enter...
a|
Which objects are available
a|
`statistics catalog object show`
a|
Specific objects that are available
a|
`statistics catalog object show -object _object_name_`
a|
Which counters are available
a|
`statistics catalog counter show -object _object_name_`
|===
Learn more about `statistics catalog object show` and `statistics catalog counter show` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/search.html?q=statistics+catalog[ONTAP command reference^].

. Return to the admin privilege level:
+
`set -privilege admin`

.Examples

The following command displays descriptions of selected statistic objects related to CIFS and SMB access in the cluster as seen at the advanced privilege level:

cluster1::> set -privilege advanced

Warning: These advanced commands are potentially dangerous; use them only when directed to do so by support personnel.

cluster1::*> statistics catalog object show -object smb1
    smb1                        These counters report activity from the SMB

                                ...

cluster1::*> statistics catalog object show -object smb2
    smb2                        These counters report activity from the

cluster1::*> statistics catalog object show -object hashd
    hashd                       The hashd object provides counters to measure
                                the performance of the BranchCache hash daemon.
cluster1::*> set -privilege admin

The following command displays information about some of the counters for the `cifs` object as seen at the advanced privilege level:
