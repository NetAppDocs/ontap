ONTAP features allow you to enable nondisruptive operations for two Microsoft applications over the SMB protocol: Microsoft Hyper-V and Microsoft SQL Server.

You should use these procedures if you want to implement SMB nondisruptive operations under the following circumstances:

* Basic SMB protocol file access has been configured.
* You want to enable SMB 3.0 or later file shares residing in SVMs to store the following objects:
 ** Hyper-V virtual machine files
 ** SQL Server system databases
