= Configure ONTAP for Microsoft Hyper-V and SQL Server over SMB solutions

[.lead]
You can use continuously available SMB 3.0 and later file shares to store Hyper-V virtual machine files or SQL Server system databases and user databases on volumes residing in SVMs, while at the same time providing nondisruptive operations (NDOs) for both planned and unplanned events.

== Microsoft Hyper-V over SMB

To create a Hyper-V over SMB solution, you must first configure ONTAP to provide storage services for Microsoft Hyper-V servers. Additionally, you must also configure Microsoft clusters (if using a clustered configuration), Hyper-V servers, continuously available SMB 3.0 connections to the shares hosted by the CIFS server, and, optionally, backup services to protect the virtual machine files that are stored on SVM volumes.

[NOTE]
====
The Hyper-V servers must be configured on Windows 2012 Server or later. Both stand-alone and clustered Hyper-V server configurations are supported.
====

* For information about creating Microsoft clusters and Hyper-V servers, see the Microsoft web site.
* SnapManager for Hyper-V is a host-based application that facilitates rapid, snapshot-based backup services, designed to integrate with Hyper-V over SMB configurations.

For information about using SnapManager with Hyper-V over SMB configurations, see _SnapManager for Hyper-V Installation and Administration Guide_.

== Microsoft SQL Server over SMB

To create a SQL Server over SMB solution, you must first configure ONTAP to provide storage services for the Microsoft SQL Server application. Additionally, you must also configure Microsoft clusters (if using a clustered configuration). You would then install and configure SQL Server on the Windows servers and create continuously available SMB 3.0 connections to the shares hosted by the CIFS server. You can optionally configure backup services to protect the database files that are stored on SVM volumes.

[NOTE]
====
SQL Server must be installed and configured on Windows 2012 Server or later. Both stand-alone and clustered configurations are supported.

* SnapCenter Plug-in for Microsoft SQL Server is a host-based application that facilitates rapid, snapshot-based backup services, designed to integrate with SQL Server over SMB configurations.
