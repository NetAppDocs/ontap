[.lead]
After an SVM migration has completed, clients are cut over to the destination cluster automatically and the unnecessary SVM is removed from the source cluster. Automatic cutover and automatic source cleanup are enabled by default. If necessary, you can disable client auto-cutover to suspend the migration before cutover occurs and you can also disable automatic source SVM cleanup.

* You can use the `-auto-cutover false` option to suspend the migration when automatic client cutover normally occurs and then manually perform the cutover later.

* You can use the advance privilege `-auto-source-cleanup false` option to disable the removal of the source SVM after cutover and then trigger source cleanup manually later, after cutover.

== Migrate an SVM with automatic cutover enabled

By default, clients are cut over to the destination cluster automatically when the migration is complete, and the unnecessary SVM is removed from the source cluster.

.Steps

. From the destination cluster, run the migration prechecks:
+
`dest_cluster> vserver migrate start -vserver _SVM_name_ -source-cluster _cluster_name_ -check-only true`
. From the destination cluster, start the SVM migration:
+
`dest_cluster> vserver migrate start -vserver _SVM_name_ -source-cluster _cluster_name_`
. Check the migration status:
+
`dest_cluster> vserver migrate show`
+
The status displays migrate-complete when the SVM migration is finished.

== Migrate an SVM with automatic client cutover disabled

You can use the -auto-cutover false option to suspend the migration when automatic client cutover normally occurs and then manually perform the cutover later. See “Manually cut over clients after SVM migration.”

.Steps

.	From the destination cluster, run the migration prechecks:
+
`dest_cluster> vserver migrate start -vserver _SVM_name_ -source-cluster _cluster_name_ -check-only true`
.	From the destination cluster, start the SVM migration:
+
`dest_cluster> vserver migrate start -vserver _SVM_name_ -source-cluster _cluster_name_ -auto-cutover false`
.	Check the migration status:
+
`dest_cluster> vserver migrate show`
The status displays ready-for-cutover when SVM migration completes the asynchronous data transfers, and it is ready for cutover operation.


== Migrate an SVM with source cleanup disabled

You can use the advance privilege -auto-source-cleanup false option to disable the removal of the source SVM after cutover and then trigger source cleanup manually later, after cutover. See “Manually remove source SVM.”

.Steps

. From the destination cluster, run the migration prechecks:
+
`dest_cluster*> vserver migrate start -vserver _SVM_name_ -source-cluster _cluster_name_ -check-only true`
.	From the destination cluster, start the SVM migration:
+
`dest_cluster*> vserver migrate start -vserver _SVM_name_ -source-cluster _cluster_name_ -auto-source-cleanup false`
.	Check the migration status:
+
`dest_cluster*> vserver migrate show`
+
The status displays ready-for-source-cleanup when SVM migration cutover is complete, and it is ready to remove the SVM on the source cluster.
