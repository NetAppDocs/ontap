[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, cluster administrators can non-disruptively relocate an SVM from a source cluster to a destination cluster to manage capacity and load balancing, or to enable equipment upgrades or data center consolidations. Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, this feature is supported on FAS and AFF platforms and on hybrid aggregates.

The SVM’s name and UUID remain unchanged after migration, as well as the data LIF name, IP address, and object names, such as the volume name. The UUID of the objects in the SVM will be different.

== SVM migration workflow

The diagram depicts the typical workflow for an SVM migration. You start an SVM migration from the destination cluster. You can monitor the migration from either the source or the destination. You can perform a manual cutover or an automatic cutover. An automatic cutover is performed by default.

|===

== Prerequisites

* You are a cluster administrator
* The source and destination clusters are peered to each other
* The source and destination clusters have the Data Protection Bundle license installed
* All nodes in the source cluster must be running ONTAP 9.10.1 or later
* All nodes in the source cluster must be running the same ONTAP version
* The destination cluster is at the same or newer effective cluster version (ECV) as the source cluster
* The source and destination clusters must support the same IP subnet for data LIF access
* The network connecting the source and destination clusters must have a maximum round trip time (RTT) of less than 10ms
* The source SVM contains fewer than the maximum number of supported data volumes for the release. The maximum number of data volumes supported is as follows:
** AFF arrays: 100
** FAS platforms: 80
* Sufficient space for volume placement is available on the destination
* Onboard Key Manager must be configured on the destination if the source SVM has encrypted volumes

== Conflicting operations

You should check for operations that can conflict with an SVM migration:

* No failover operations are in progress
* WAFLIRON cannot be running
* Fingerprint is not in progress
* Vol move, rehost, clone, create, convert or analytics are not running

| Asynchronous SnapMirror copy-to-cloud relationships
| No
| No
| Yes
| Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, when you migrate an SVM with SnapMirror Copy to Cloud relationships, the migrate destination cluster must have the copy to cloud license installed and must have enough capacity available to support moving the capacity in the volumes that are being mirrored to the cloud.

| Asynchronous SnapMirror destination
| No
| No
| Yes
|

| Asynchronous SnapMirror source
| No
| Yes
| Yes
a|
* Transfers can continue as normal on FlexVol SnapMirror relationships during most of the migration.
* Any ongoing transfers are canceled during cutover and new transfers fail during cutover and they cannot be restarted until the migration completes.
* Scheduled transfers that were canceled or missed during the migration are not automatically started after the migrate completes.

[NOTE]
====
When a SnapMirror source is migrated, ONTAP does not prevent deletion of the volume after migration until the SnapMirror update takes place after. This happens because SnapMirror-related information for migrated SnapMirror source volumes is known only after first update after migrate is complete.

| Autonomous Ransomware Protection
| No
| No
| Yes
|

| External key manager
| No
| Yes
| Yes
|

| Fanout relationships (the migrating source has a SnapMirror source volume with more than one destination)
| No
| Yes
| Yes
|

| Job schedule replication
| No
| Yes
| Yes
| In ONTAP 9.10.1, job schedules are not replicated during migration and must be manually created on the destination. Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, job schedules used by the source are replicated automatically during migration.

| NetApp Volume Encryption
| Yes
| Yes
| Yes
|

| NFS v3, NFS v4.1, and NFS v4.2 protocols
| Yes
| Yes
| Yes

* Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, SVM migrate includes disruptive migration with SMB. 

| SVM peering for SnapMirror applications
| No
