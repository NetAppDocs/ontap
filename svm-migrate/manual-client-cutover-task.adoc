By default, client cutover to the destination cluster is performed automatically after the SVM migration reaches "ready-for-cutover" state. If you choose to disable automatic client cutover, you need to perform the client cutover manually.

.Steps

. Manually execute client cutover:
+
`* dest_cluster> vserver migrate cutover -vserver <vserver name>*`
. Check the status of the cutover operation:
+
`* dest_cluster> vserver migrate show*`
