[.lead]
If you need to cancel an SVM migration before it completes, you can use the `vserver migrate abort` command. You can cancel an SVM migration only when the operation is in the paused or failed state. You cannot cancel an SVM migration when the status is "cutover-started" or after cutover is complete. You cannot use the `abort` option when an SVM migration is in progress.

.Steps

. On the destination cluster, check the migration status:
+
[source,cli]
----
vserver migrate show -vserver <SVM_name>
----

. Cancel the migration:
+
[source,cli]
----
vserver migrate abort -vserver <SVM_name>
----

. Check the progress of the cancel operation:
+
[source,cli]
----
vserver migrate show
----
+
The migration status shows migrate-aborting while the cancel operation is in progress. When the cancel operation completes, the migration status shows nothing.
