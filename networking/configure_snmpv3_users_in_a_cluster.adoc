SNMPv3 is a secure protocol when compared to SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c. To use SNMPv3, you must configure an SNMPv3 user to run the SNMP utilities from the SNMP manager.

.Step

Use the "security login create command" to create an SNMPv3 user.

You are prompted to provide the following information:

* Engine ID: Default and recommended value is local Engine ID
* Authentication protocol
* Authentication password
* Privacy protocol
* Privacy protocol password

.Result

The SNMPv3 user can log in from the SNMP manager by using the user name and password and run the SNMP utility commands.

== SNMPv3 security parameters

SNMPv3 includes an authentication feature that, when selected, requires users to enter their names, an authentication protocol, an authentication key, and their desired security level when invoking a command.

The following table lists the SNMPv3 security parameters :

[cols="25,25,50"]
|===

h| Parameter h| Command-line option h| Description

a|engineID
a|-e EngineID
a|Engine ID of the SNMP agent. Default value is local EngineID (recommended).
a|securityName
a|-u Name
a|User name must not exceed 32 characters.
a|authProtocol
a|-a {none \| MD5 \| SHA \| SHA-256}
a|Authentication type can be none, MD5, SHA, or SHA-256.
a|authKey
a|-A PASSPHRASE
a|Passphrase with a minimum of eight characters.
a|securityLevel
a|-l {authNoPriv \| AuthPriv \| noAuthNoPriv}
a|Security level can be Authentication, No Privacy; Authentication, Privacy; or no Authentication, no Privacy.
a|privProtocol
a|-x { none \| des \| aes128}
a|Privacy protocol can be none, des, or aes128
a|privPassword
a|-X password
a|Password with a minimum of eight characters.
|===

== Examples for different security levels

This example shows how an SNMPv3 user created with different security levels can use the SNMP client-side commands, such as `snmpwalk`, to query the cluster objects.

For better performance, you should retrieve all objects in a table rather than a single object or a few objects from the table.

[NOTE]
You must use `snmpwalk` 5.3.1 or later when the authentication protocol is SHA.

=== Security level: authPriv

The following output shows the creation of an SNMPv3 user with the authPriv security level.

....
security login create -username snmpv3user -application snmp -authmethod usm
Enter the authoritative entity's EngineID [local EngineID]:
Which authentication protocol do you want to choose  (none, md5, sha) [none]:sha
....

==== FIPS mode

....
security login create -username snmpv3user -application snmp -authmethod usm
Enter the authoritative entity's EngineID [local EngineID]:
Which authentication protocol do you want to choose (sha, sha2-256) [sha]

Enter authentication protocol password (minimum 8 characters long):
Enter authentication protocol password again:
Which privacy protocol do you want to choose (aes128) [aes128]:
Enter privacy protocol password (minimum 8 characters long):
Enter privacy protocol password again:
....

==== snmpwalk Test

The following output shows the SNMPv3 user running the snmpwalk command:

For better performance, you should retrieve all objects in a table rather than a single object or a few objects from the table.

....
$ snmpwalk -v 3 -u snmpv3user -a SHA -A password1! -x DES -X password1! -l authPriv 192.0.2.62 .1.3.6.1.4.1.789.1.5.8.1.2
Enterprises.789.1.5.8.1.2.1028 = "vol0"
Enterprises.789.1.5.8.1.2.1032 = "vol0"
Enterprises.789.1.5.8.1.2.1038 = "root_vs0"
Enterprises.789.1.5.8.1.2.1042 = "root_vstrap"
Enterprises.789.1.5.8.1.2.1064 = "vol1"
....

=== Security level: authNoPriv

The following output shows the creation of an SNMPv3 user with the authNoPriv security level.

....
security login create -username snmpv3user1 -application snmp -authmethod usm -role admin
Enter the authoritative entity's EngineID [local EngineID]:
Which authentication protocol do you want to choose (none, md5, sha) [none]: md5
....

==== FIPS Mode

The cluster does not support the authNoPriv security level in FIPS mode.

==== snmpwalk Test

The following output shows the SNMPv3 user running the snmpwalk command:

For better performance, you should retrieve all objects in a table rather than a single object or a few objects from the table.

....
$ snmpwalk -v 3 -u snmpv3user1 -a MD5 -A password1!  -l authNoPriv 192.0.2.62 .1.3.6.1.4.1.789.1.5.8.1.2
Enterprises.789.1.5.8.1.2.1028 = "vol0"
Enterprises.789.1.5.8.1.2.1032 = "vol0"
Enterprises.789.1.5.8.1.2.1038 = "root_vs0"
Enterprises.789.1.5.8.1.2.1042 = "root_vstrap"
Enterprises.789.1.5.8.1.2.1064 = "vol1"
....

=== Security level: noAuthNoPriv

The following output shows the creation of an SNMPv3 user with the noAuthNoPriv security level.

....
security login create -username snmpv3user2 -application snmp -authmethod usm -role admin
Enter the authoritative entity's EngineID [local EngineID]:
Which authentication protocol do you want to choose (none, md5, sha) [none]: none
....

==== FIPS Mode

FIPS will not allow you to choose none

==== snmpwalk Test

The following output shows the SNMPv3 user running the snmpwalk command:

For better performance, you should retrieve all objects in a table rather than a single object or a few objects from the table.

....
$ snmpwalk -v 3 -u snmpv3user2 -l noAuthNoPriv 192.0.2.62 .1.3.6.1.4.1.789.1.5.8.1.2
Enterprises.789.1.5.8.1.2.1028 = "vol0"
Enterprises.789.1.5.8.1.2.1032 = "vol0"
Enterprises.789.1.5.8.1.2.1038 = "root_vs0"
Enterprises.789.1.5.8.1.2.1042 = "root_vstrap"
Enterprises.789.1.5.8.1.2.1064 = "vol1"
