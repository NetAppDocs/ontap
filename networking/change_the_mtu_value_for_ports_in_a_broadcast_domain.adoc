[.lead]
You can modify the MTU value for a broadcast domain to change the MTU value for all ports in that broadcast domain. This can be done to support topology changes that have been made in the network.

[NOTE]
The procedure for changing the MTU value for broadcast domain ports is different in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier versions. If you need to change the MTU value for broadcast domain ports on a network running ONTAP 9.7 and earlier, refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-system-manager-classic/networking-bd/change_the_mtu_value_for_ports_in_a_broadcast_domain97.html[Change the MTU value for ports in a broadcast domain (ONTAP 9.7 and earlier)^].

.System Manager
--
Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, you can use System Manager to modify the MTU value for a broadcast domain to change the MTU value for all ports in that broadcast domain.

.Steps
. Select *Network > Broadcast Domains*.
. In the *Broadcast Domains* section, select the name of the broadcast domain for which you want to change the MTU value.
. A prompt appears to confirm that you want to change the MTU value for all ports in the broadcast domain. Click *Yes* to proceed with the change.
. Modify the MTU value as needed and save your changes.
+
The system applies the new MTU value to all ports in the broadcast domain, which causes a brief interruption in traffic over those ports.
--

.CLI
--
.Before you begin

The MTU value must match all the devices connected to that layer 2 network except for the e0M port handling management traffic.

.About this task

Changing the MTU value causes a brief interruption in traffic over the affected ports. The system displays a prompt that you must answer with *y* to make the MTU change.

.Step

Change the MTU value for all ports in a broadcast domain:

----
network port broadcast-domain modify -broadcast-domain <broadcast_domain_name> -mtu <mtu_value> [-ipspace <ipspace_name>]
----
Where:

* `broadcast_domain` is the name of the broadcast domain.
* `mtu` is the MTU size for IP packets; 1500 and 9000 are typical values.
* `ipspace` is the name of the IPspace in which this broadcast domain resides. The "Default" IPspace is used unless you specify a value for this option. 
+
The following command changes the MTU to 9000 for all ports in the broadcast domain bcast1:
+
----
network port broadcast-domain modify -broadcast-domain <Default-1> -mtu < 9000 >
Warning: Changing broadcast domain settings will cause a momentary data-serving interruption.
Do you want to continue? {y|n}: <y>
