[.lead]
After you upgrade from ONTAP 9.7x or earlier to ONTAP 9.8 or later, you should verify your network configuration. After the upgrade, ONTAP automatically monitors layer 2 reachability.

.Step

. Verify each port has reachability to its expected broadcast domain:
+
[source,cli]
----
network port reachability show -detail
----

The command output contains reachability results. Use the following decision tree and table to understand the reachability results (reachability-status) and determine what, if anything, to do next.

h|reachability-status h|Description

a|ok
a|The port has layer 2 reachability to its assigned broadcast domain.

If the reachability-status is "ok", but there are "unexpected ports", consider merging one or more broadcast domains. For more information, see link:merge_broadcast_domains.html[Merge broadcast domains].

If the reachability-status is "ok", but there are "unreachable ports", consider splitting one or more broadcast domains. For more information, see link:split_broadcast_domains.html[Split broadcast domains].

If the reachability-status is "ok", and there are no unexpected or unreachable ports, your configuration is correct.
a|misconfigured-reachability
a|The port does not have layer 2 reachability to its assigned broadcast domain; however, the port does have layer 2 reachability to a different broadcast domain.

You can repair the port reachability. When you run the following command, the system will assign the port to the broadcast domain to which it has reachability:

`network port reachability repair -node -port`

For more information, see link:repair_port_reachability.html[Repair port reachability].

Learn more about `network port reachability repair` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/network-port-reachability-repair.html[ONTAP command reference^]. 
a|no-reachability
a|The port does not have layer 2 reachability to any existing broadcast domain.

You can repair the port reachability. When you run the following command, the system will assign the port to a new automatically created broadcast domain in the Default IPspace:

`network port reachability repair -node -port`

For more information, see link:repair_port_reachability.html[Repair port reachability].
a|multi-domain-reachability
a|The port has layer 2 reachability to its assigned broadcast domain; however, it also has layer 2 reachability to at least one other broadcast domain.

Examine the physical connectivity and switch configuration to determine if it is incorrect or if the portâ€™s assigned broadcast domain needs to be merged with one or more broadcast domains.

For more information, see link:merge_broadcast_domains.html[Merge broadcast domains] or link:repair_port_reachability.html[Repair port reachability].
a|unknown
a|If the reachability-status is "unknown", then wait a few minutes and try the command again.

After you repair a port, you need to check for and resolve displaced LIFs and VLANs. If the port was part of an interface group, you also need to understand what happened to that interface group.  For more information, see link:repair_port_reachability.html[Repair port reachability].
