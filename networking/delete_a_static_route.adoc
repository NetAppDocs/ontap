You can delete an unneeded static route from a storage virtual machine (SVM).

.Step

Use the `network route delete` command to delete a static route.

For more information about this command, see the link:http://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/network-route-delete.html[command reference for `network route`].

The following example deletes a static route associated with SVM vs0 with a gateway of 10.63.0.1 and a destination IP address of 0.0.0.0/0:

....
network route delete -vserver vs0 -gateway 10.63.0.1 -destination 0.0.0.0/0
....
