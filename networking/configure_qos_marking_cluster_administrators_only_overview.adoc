Network Quality of Service (QoS) marking helps you to prioritize different traffic types based on the network conditions to effectively use the network resources. You can set the differentiated services code point (DSCP) value of the outgoing IP packets for the supported traffic types per IPspace.

== DSCP marking for UC compliance

You can enable differentiated services code point (DSCP) marking on outgoing (egress) IP packet traffic for a given protocol with a default or user-provided DSCP code. DSCP marking is a mechanism for classifying and managing network traffic and is a component of Unified Capability (UC) compliance.

DSCP marking (also known as _QoS marking_ or _quality of service marking_) is enabled by providing an IPspace, protocol, and DSCP value. The protocols on which DSCP marking can be applied are NFS, SMB, iSCSI, SnapMirror, NDMP, FTP, HTTP/HTTPS, SSH, Telnet, and SNMP.

If you do not provide a DSCP value when enabling DSCP marking for a given protocol, a default is used:

* The default value for data protocols/traffic is 0x0A (10).
* The default value for control protocols/traffic is 0x30 (48).
