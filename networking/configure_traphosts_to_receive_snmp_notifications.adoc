[.lead]
You can configure the traphost (SNMP manager) to receive notifications (SNMP trap PDUs) when SNMP traps are generated in the cluster. You can specify either the host name or the IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the SNMP traphost.

.Before you begin

* SNMP and SNMP traps must be enabled on the cluster.

[NOTE]
SNMP and SNMP traps are enabled by default.

* DNS must be configured on the cluster for resolving the traphost names.
* IPv6 must be enabled on the cluster to configure SNMP traphosts by using IPv6 addresses.
* You must have specified the authentication of a predefined User-based Security Model (USM) and privacy credentials when creating traphosts.

.Step

Add an SNMP traphost:

....
system snmp traphost add
....

[NOTE]
Traps can be sent only when at least one SNMP management station is specified as a traphost.

The following command adds a new SNMPv3 traphost named yyy.example.com with a known USM user:

....
system snmp traphost add -peer-address yyy.example.com -usm-username MyUsmUser
....

The following command adds a traphost using the IPv6 address of the host:

....
system snmp traphost add -peer-address 2001:0db8:1:1:209:6bff:feae:6d67
....
