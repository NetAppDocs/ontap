[.lead]
When ICMP redirects are received for IPv4 and IPv6, dynamic routes are added to the routing table. By default, the dynamic routes are removed after 300 seconds. If you want to maintain dynamic routes for a different amount of time, you can change the time out value.

.About this task

You can set the timeout value from 0 to 65,535 seconds. If you set the value to 0, the routes never expire. Removing dynamic routes prevents loss of connectivity caused by the persistence of invalid routes.

.Steps

. Display the current timeout value.
+
* For IPv4:
+
....
network tuning icmp show
....

* For IPv6:
+
....
network tuning icmp6 show
....

. Modify the timeout value.
+
* For IPv4:
+
....
network tuning icmp modify -node node_name -redirect-timeout timeout_value
....

* For IPv6:
+
....
network tuning icmp6 modify -node node_name -redirect-v6-timeout timeout_value
....

. Verify that the timeout value was modified correctly.
+
* For IPv4:
+
....
network tuning icmp show
....

* For IPv6:
+
....
network tuning icmp6 show
....
