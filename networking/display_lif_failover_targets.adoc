You might have to check whether the failover policies and the failover groups of a LIF are configured correctly. To prevent misconfiguration of the failover rules, you can display the failover targets for a single LIF or for all LIFs.

.About this task

Displaying LIF failover targets enables you to check for the following:

* Whether the LIFs are configured with the correct failover group and failover policy
* Whether the resulting list of failover target ports is appropriate for each LIF
* Whether the failover target of a data LIF is not a management port (e0M)

.Step

Display the failover targets of a LIF by using the `failover` option of the `network interface show` command.

The following command displays information about the failover targets for all LIFs in a two-node cluster. The `Failover` `Targets` row shows the (prioritized) list of node-port combinations for a given LIF.
