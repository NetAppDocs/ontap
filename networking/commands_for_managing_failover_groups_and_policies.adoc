[.lead]
You can use the `network interface failover-groups` commands to manage failover groups. You use the `network interface modify` command to manage the failover groups and failover policies that are applied to a LIF.

|===

h|If you want to... h|Use this command...

a| Add network ports to a failover group
a| `network interface failover-groups add-targets`

a| Remove network ports from a failover group
a| `network interface failover-groups remove-targets`

a| Modify network ports in a failover group
a| `network interface failover-groups modify`

a| Display the current failover groups
a| `network interface failover-groups show`

a| Configure failover on a LIF
a| `network interface modify -failover-group -failover-policy`

a| Display the failover group and failover policy that is being used by each LIF
a| `network interface show -fields failover-group, failover-policy`

a| Rename a failover group
a| `network interface failover-groups rename`

a| Delete a failover group
a| `network interface failover-groups delete`

|===

[NOTE]
Modifying a failover group such that it does not provide a valid failover target for any LIF in the cluster can result in an outage when a LIF attempts to fail over.
