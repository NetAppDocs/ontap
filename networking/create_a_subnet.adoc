[.lead]
You can create a subnet to allocate specific blocks of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses to be used later when you create LIFs for the SVM.

This enables you to create LIFs more easily by specifying a subnet name instead of having to specify IP address and network mask values for each LIF.

.Before you begin

You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.

.Procedure

The procedure you follow depends on the interface that you use--System Manager or the CLI:

.System Manager
--
Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.0, you can use System Manager to create a subnet.

.Steps

. Select *Network > Overview > Subnets*.

. Click image:icon_add.gif[add icon] to create a subnet.

. Name the subnet.

. Specify the subnet IP address.

. Set the subnet mask.

. Define the range of IP addresses that comprise the subnet.

. If useful, specify a gateway.

. Select the broadcast domain to which the subnet belongs.

. Save your changes.

.. If the IP address or range entered is already used by an interface, the following message is displayed:
`An IP address in this range is already in use by a LIF. Associate the LIF with this subnet?`

.. When you click *OK*, the existing LIF will be associated with the subnet.

.CLI
--
Use the CLI to create a subnet.

.Steps

. Create a subnet.
+

`network subnet create -broadcast-domain _ipspace1_ -ipspace _ipspace1_ -subnet-name _ipspace1_ -subnet _10.0.0.0/24_ -gateway _10.0.0.1_ -ip-ranges _"10.0.0.128-10.0.0.130,10.0.0.132"_`
+
The subnet name can be either a subnet IP value such as `192.0.2.0/24` or a string such as `ipspace1` like the one used in this example.

. Verify that the subnet configuration is correct.
+
The output from this example shows information about the subnet named ipspace1 in the ipspace1 IPspace. The subnet belongs to the broadcast domain name ipspace1. You can assign the IP addresses in this subnet to data LIFs for SVMs created in the ipspace1 IPspace.
+
`network subnet show -ipspace _ipspace1_`
