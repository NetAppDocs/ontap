[.lead]
If you want the Active Directory-integrated DNS server to dynamically register the DNS records of an NFS or SMB server in DNS, you must configure dynamic DNS (DDNS) on the SVM.

.Before you begin

DNS name services must be configured on the SVM. If you are using secure DDNS, you must use Active Directory-integrated DNS name servers and you must have created either an NFS or SMB server or an Active Directory account for the SVM.

.About this task

The specified FQDN must be unique.

[NOTE]
To avoid a configuration failure of an SVM FQDN that is not compliant to RFC rules for DDNS updates, use an FQDN name that is RFC compliant.

.Steps

. Configure DDNS on the SVM:
+
`vserver services name-service dns dynamic-update modify -vserver _vserver_name_ -is- enabled _true_ [-use-secure {true|false} -vserver-fqdn _FQDN_used_for_DNS_updates_`
+
`vserver services name-service dns dynamic-update modify -vserver _vs1_ -is-enabled _true_ - use-secure _true_ -vserver-fqdn _vs1.example.com_`
+
Asterisks cannot be used as part of the customized FQDN. For example, `*.netapp.com` is not valid.

. Verify that the DDNS configuration is correct:
+
`vserver services name-service dns dynamic-update show`
+
....
