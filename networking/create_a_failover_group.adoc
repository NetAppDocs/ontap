You create a failover group of network ports so that a LIF can automatically migrate to a different port if a link failure occurs on the LIF's current port. This enables the system to reroute network traffic to other available ports in the cluster.

.About this task

You use the `network interface failover-groups create` command to create the group and to add ports to the group.

* The ports added to a failover group can be network ports, VLANs, or interface groups (ifgrps).
* All the ports added to the failover group must belong to the same broadcast domain.
* A single port can reside in multiple failover groups.
* If you have LIFs in different VLANs or broadcast domains, you must configure failover groups for each VLAN or broadcast domain.
* Failover groups do not apply in SAN iSCSI or FC environments.

.Step

Create a failover group:

`network interface failover-groups create -vserver _vserver_name_ -failover-group _failover_group_name_ -targets _ports_list_`

* `_vserver_name_` is the name of the SVM that can use the failover group.
* `_failover_group_name_` is the name of the failover group you want to create.
* `_ports_list_` is the list of ports that will be added to the failover group.
Ports are added in the format _node_name>:<port_number>_, for example, node1:e0c.

The following command creates failover group fg3 for SVM vs3 and adds two ports:

....
network interface failover-groups create -vserver vs3 -failover-group fg3 -targets cluster1-01:e0e,cluster1-02:e0e
....

.After you finish

* You should apply the failover group to a LIF now that the failover group has been created.
* Applying a failover group that does not provide a valid failover target for a LIF results in a warning message.
+
If a LIF that does not have a valid failover target attempts to fail over, an outage might occur.
