You can display information about an interface group to determine its configuration.

.About this task

The following information is displayed:

* Node on which the interface group is located
* List of network ports that are included in the interface group
* Interface group's name
* Distribution function (MAC, IP, port, or sequential)
* Interface group's Media Access Control (MAC) address
* Port activity status; that is, whether all aggregated ports are active (full participation), whether some are active (partial participation), or whether none are active

.Step

Display information about interface groups by using the `network port ifgrp show` command.

You can display detailed information for each node by specifying the `-instance` parameter. You can display specific information by specifying field names using the `-fields` parameter.

The following command displays information about all interface groups in the cluster:

....

The following command displays detailed interface group information for a single node:

....
network port ifgrp show -instance -node cluster-1-01

                 Node: cluster-1-01
 Interface Group Name: a0a
Distribution Function: ip
        Create Policy: multimode
          MAC Address: 02:a0:98:06:10:b2
   Port Participation: full
        Network Ports: e7a, e7b
             Up Ports: e7a, e7b
           Down Ports: -
