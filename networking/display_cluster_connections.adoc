You can display all the active connections in the cluster or a count of active connections on the node by client, logical interface, protocol, or service. You can also display all the listening connections in the cluster.

== Display active connections by client (cluster administrators only)

You can view the active connections by client to verify the node that a specific client is using and to view possible imbalances between client counts per node.

.About this task

The count of active connections by client is useful in the following scenarios:

* Finding a busy or overloaded node.
* Determining why a particular client's access to a volume is slow.
+
You can view details about the node that the client is accessing and then compare it with the node on which the volume resides. If accessing the volume requires traversing the cluster network, clients might experience decreased performance because of the remote access to the volume on an oversubscribed remote node.

* Verifying that all nodes are being used equally for data access.
* Finding clients that have an unexpectedly high number of connections.
* Verifying whether certain clients have connections to a node.

.Step

Display a count of the active connections by client on a node by using the `network connections active show-clients` command.

Learn more about the link:http://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/network-connections-active-show-clients.html[`network connections active show-clients`^] command in the ONTAP command reference.

....

== Display active connections by protocol (cluster administrators only)

You can display a count of the active connections by protocol (TCP or UDP) on a node to compare the usage of protocols within the cluster.

.About this task

The count of active connections by protocol is useful in the following scenarios:

* Finding the UDP clients that are losing their connection.
+
If a node is near its connection limit, UDP clients are the first to be dropped.

* Verifying that no other protocols are being used.

.Step

Display a count of the active connections by protocol on a node by using the `network connections active show-protocols` command.

For more information about this command, see the man page.

....

         Cluster       TCP             4
....

== Display active connections by service (cluster administrators only)

You can display a count of the active connections by service type (for example, by NFS, SMB, mount, and so on) for each node in a cluster. This is useful to compare the usage of services within the cluster, which helps to determine the primary workload of a node.

.About this task

The count of active connections by service is useful in the following scenarios:

* Verifying that all nodes are being used for the appropriate services and that the load balancing for that service is working.
* Verifying that no other services are being used. Display a count of the active connections by service on a node by using the `network connections active show-services` command.

For more information about this command, see the man page: link:../concepts/manual-pages.html[ONTAP command reference]

....
network connections active show-services

== Display active connections by LIF on a node and SVM

You can display a count of active connections for each LIF, by node and storage virtual machine (SVM), to view connection imbalances between LIFs within the cluster.

.About this task

The count of active connections by LIF is useful in the following scenarios:

* Finding an overloaded LIF by comparing the number of connections on each LIF.
* Verifying that DNS load balancing is working for all data LIFs.
* Comparing the number of connections to the various SVMs to find the SVMs that are used the most.

.Step

Display a count of active connections for each LIF by SVM and node by using the `network connections active show-lifs` command.

For more information about this command, see the man page: link:../concepts/manual-pages.html[ONTAP command reference]

....

== Display active connections in a cluster

You can display information about the active connections in a cluster to view the LIF, port, remote host, service, storage virtual machines (SVMs), and protocol used by individual connections.

.About this task

Viewing the active connections in a cluster is useful in the following scenarios:

* Verifying that individual clients are using the correct protocol and service on the correct node.
* If a client is having trouble accessing data using a certain combination of node, protocol, and service, you can use this command to find a similar client for configuration or packet trace comparison.

.Step

Display the active connections in a cluster by using the `network connections active show` command.

For more information about this command, see the man page: link:../concepts/manual-pages.html[ONTAP command reference].

The following command shows the active connections on the node node1:

....
network connections active show -node node1
Vserver  Interface           Remote

vs1      data1:111           host1.aa.com:10741  UDP/port-map
vs3      data2:111           host1.aa.com:10741  UDP/port-map
vs1      data1:111           host1.aa.com:12017  UDP/port-map
vs3      data2:111           host1.aa.com:12017  UDP/port-map
....

The following command shows the active connections on SVM vs1:

....
network connections active show -vserver vs1
Vserver  Interface           Remote
Name     Name:Local Port     Host:Port           Protocol/Service

== Display listening connections in a cluster

You can display information about the listening connections in a cluster to view the LIFs and ports that are accepting connections for a given protocol and service.

.About this task

Viewing the listening connections in a cluster is useful in the following scenarios:

* Verifying that the desired protocol or service is listening on a LIF if client connections to that LIF fail consistently.
* Verifying that a UDP/rclopcp listener is opened at each cluster LIF if remote data access to a volume on one node through a LIF on another node fails.
* Verifying that a UDP/rclopcp listener is opened at each cluster LIF if SnapMirror transfers between two nodes in the same cluster fail.
* Verifying that a TCP/ctlopcp listener is opened at each intercluster LIF if SnapMirror transfers between two nodes in different clusters fail.

.Step

Display the listening connections per node by using the `network connections listening show` command.

....
