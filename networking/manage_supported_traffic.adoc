Over time, the way in which ONTAP manages the type of traffic supported on LIFs has changed. 

* ONTAP 9.5 and earlier releases use LIF roles and firewall services. 
* ONTAP 9.6 and later releases use LIF service policies: 
** ONTAP 9.5 release introduced LIF service policies.
** ONTAP 9.6 replaced LIF roles with LIF service policies.
** ONTAP 9.10.1 replaced firewall services with LIF service policies.

The method you configure depends on the release of ONTAP you are using.
