Several well-known ports are reserved for ONTAP communications with specific services. Port conflicts occur if a port value in your storage network environment is the same as the value on an ONTAP port.

== Inbound traffic

Inbound traffic on your ONTAP storage uses the following protocols and ports:

== Outbound traffic

Outbound traffic on your ONTAP storage can be set up using basic or advanced rules depending on business needs.

=== Basic outbound rules

All ports can be used for all outbound traffic over ICMP, TCP, and UDP protocols.

=== Advanced outbound rules

If you need rigid rules for outbound traffic, you can use the following information to open only those ports that are required for outbound communication by ONTAP.
