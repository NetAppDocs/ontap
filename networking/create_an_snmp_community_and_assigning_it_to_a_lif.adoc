[.lead]
You can create an SNMP community that acts as an authentication mechanism between the management station and the storage virtual machine (SVM) when using SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c.

By creating SNMP communities in a data SVM, you can execute commands such as `snmpwalk` and `snmpget` on the data LIFs.

.About this task

* In new installations of ONTAP, SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c are disabled by default.
+
SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c are enabled after you create an SNMP community.
* ONTAP supports read-only communities.
* By default, the "data" firewall policy that is assigned to data LIFs has SNMP service set to `deny`.
+
You must create a new firewall policy with SNMP service set to `allow` when creating an SNMP user for a data SVM.
+
NOTE: Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, firewall policies are deprecated and wholly replaced with LIF service policies. For more information, see link:../networking/configure_firewall_policies_for_lifs.html[Configure firewall policies for LIFs].
* You can create SNMP communities for SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c users for both the admin SVM and the data SVM.
* Because an SVM is not part of the SNMP standard, queries on data LIFs must include the NetApp root OID (1.3.6.1.4.1.789)â€”for example, `snmpwalk -v 2c -c snmpNFS 10.238.19.14 1.3.6.1.4.1.789`.

.Steps

. Create an SNMP community by using the `system snmp community add` command. The following command shows how to create an SNMP community in the admin SVM cluster-1:
+
....
system snmp community add -type ro -community-name comty1 -vserver cluster-1
....
+
The following command shows how to create an SNMP community in the data SVM vs1:
+
....
system snmp community add -type ro -community-name comty2 -vserver vs1
....

. Verify that the communities have been created by using the system snmp community show command.
+
The following command shows the two communities created for SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c:
+
....
system snmp community show
cluster-1
rocomty1
vs1
rocomty2
....

. Check whether SNMP is allowed as a service in the "data" firewall policy by using the `system services firewall policy` `show` command.
+
The following command shows that the snmp service is not allowed in the default "data" firewall policy (the snmp service is allowed in the "mgmt" firewall policy only):
+
....
system services firewall policy show
Vserver Policy       Service    Allowed

                     https      0.0.0.0/0
                     ndmp       0.0.0.0/0
                     ndmps      0.0.0.0/0
                     ntp        0.0.0.0/0
                     snmp       0.0.0.0/0
                     ssh        0.0.0.0/0
....

. Create a new firewall policy that allows access using the `snmp` service by using the `system services firewall policy create` command.
+
The following commands create a new data firewall policy named "data1" that allows the `snmp`
+
....
system services firewall policy create -policy data1 -service snmp -vserver  vs1 -allow-list 0.0.0.0/0

cluster-1::> system services firewall policy show -service snmp
Vserver  Policy       Service    Allowed
-------  ------------ ---------- -------------------
cluster-1
         mgmt
                      snmp       0.0.0.0/0
vs1
         data1
                      snmp       0.0.0.0/0
....

. Apply the firewall policy to a data LIF by using the `network interface modify` command with the -firewall-policy parameter.
+
The following command assigns the new "data1" firewall policy to LIF "datalif1":
+
....
network interface modify -vserver vs1 -lif datalif1 -firewall-policy data1
....
+
