[.lead]
You can display the list of broadcast domains within each IPspace in a cluster. The output also shows the list of ports and the MTU value for each broadcast domain.

[NOTE]
The procedure for displaying broadcast domains is different in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier versions. If you need to display broadcast domains on a network running ONTAP 9.7 and earlier, refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-system-manager-classic/networking-bd/display_broadcast_domains97.html[Display broadcast domains (ONTAP 9.7 or earlier)^].

.Step

Display the broadcast domains and associated ports in the cluster:

....
network port broadcast-domain show
....

The following command displays all the broadcast domains and associated ports in the cluster:

....
network port broadcast-domain show
IPspace Broadcast                                Update
Name    Domain Name  MTU   Port List             Status Details
------- ----------- -----  --------------------- --------------
Cluster Cluster      9000
                           cluster-1-01:e0a       complete
                           cluster-1-01:e0b       complete
                           cluster-1-02:e0a       complete
                           cluster-1-02:e0b       complete
Default Default      1500
                           cluster-1-01:e0c       complete
                           cluster-1-01:e0d       complete
                           cluster-1-02:e0c       complete
                           cluster-1-02:e0d       complete
        Default-1    1500
                           cluster-1-01:e0e       complete
                           cluster-1-01:e0f       complete
                           cluster-1-01:e0g       complete
                           cluster-1-02:e0e       complete
                           cluster-1-02:e0f       complete
                           cluster-1-02:e0g       complete
....

The following command displays the ports in the Default-1 broadcast domain that have an update status of error, which indicate that the port could not be updated properly:

....
network port broadcast-domain show -broadcast-domain Default-1 -port-update-status error

IPspace Broadcast                                Update
Name    Domain Name  MTU   Port List             Status Details
------- ----------- -----  --------------------- --------------
Default Default-1   1500
                           cluster-1-02:e0g       error
....
