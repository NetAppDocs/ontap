The DNS host table entries map host names to IP addresses. You can display the host names and alias names and the IP address that they map to for all SVMs in a cluster.

.Step

Display the host name entries for all SVMs by using the vserver services name-service dns hosts show command.

The following example displays the host table entries:

....
vserver services name-service dns hosts show
Vserver    Address        Hostname        Aliases
---------- -------------- --------------- ---------------------
cluster-1
           10.72.219.36   lnx219-36       -
vs1
           10.72.219.37   lnx219-37       lnx219-37.example.com
....

You can use the `vserver services name-service dns` command to enable DNS on an SVM, and configure it to use DNS for host-name resolution. Host names are resolved using external DNS servers.
