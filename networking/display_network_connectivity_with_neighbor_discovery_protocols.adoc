In a data center, you can use neighbor discovery protocols to view network connectivity between a pair of physical or virtual systems and their network interfaces. ONTAP supports two neighbor discovery protocols: Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) and Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP).

Neighbor discovery protocols enable you to automatically discover and view information about directly connected protocol-enabled devices in a network. Each device advertises identification, capabilities, and connectivity information. This information is transmitted in Ethernet frames to a multicast MAC address and is received by all neighboring protocol-enabled devices.

For two devices to become neighbors, each must have a protocol enabled and correctly configured. Discovery protocol functionality is limited to directly connected networks. Neighbors can include protocol-enabled devices such as switches, routers, bridges, and so on. ONTAP supports two neighbor discovery protocols, which can be used individually or together.

*Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP)*

CDP is a proprietary link layer protocol developed by Cisco Systems. It is enabled by default in ONTAP for cluster ports, but must be enabled explicitly for data ports.

*Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP)*

LLDP is a vendor-neutral protocol specified in the standards document IEEE 802.1AB. It must be enabled explicitly for all ports.
