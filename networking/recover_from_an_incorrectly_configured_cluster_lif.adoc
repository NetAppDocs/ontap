A cluster cannot be created when the cluster network is cabled to a switch but not all of the ports configured in the Cluster IPspace can reach the other ports configured in the Cluster IPspace.

.About this task

In a switched cluster, if a cluster network interface (LIF) is configured on the wrong port, or if a cluster port is wired into the wrong network, the `cluster create` command can fail with the following error:

....
Not all local cluster ports have reachability to one another.
Use the "network port reachability show -detail" command for more details.
....

The results of the `network port show` command might show that several ports are added to the Cluster IPspace because they are connected to a port that is configured with a cluster LIF. However, the results of the `network port` `reachability show -detail` command reveal which ports do not have connectivity to one another.

To recover from a cluster LIF configured on a port that is not reachable to the other ports configured with cluster LIFs, perform the following steps:

.Steps

. Reset the home port of the cluster LIF to the correct port:
+
....
network port modify -home-port
....

. Remove the ports that do not have cluster LIFs configured on them from the cluster broadcast domain:
+
....
network port broadcast-domain remove-ports
....

. Create the cluster:
+
....
cluster create
....

.Result

When you complete the cluster creation, the system detects the correct configuration and places the ports into the correct broadcast domains.
