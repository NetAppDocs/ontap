You can configure LIF service policies to identify a single service or a list of services that will use a LIF.

== Create a service policy for LIFs

You can create a service policy for LIFs. You can assign a service policy to one or more LIFs; thereby allowing the LIF to carry traffic for a single service or a list of services.

.About this task

Built-in services and service policies are available for managing data and management traffic on both data and system SVMs. Most use cases are satisfied using a built-in service policy rather than creating a custom service policy.

You can modify these built-in service policies, if required.

.Steps

. View the services that are available in the cluster:
+
....
network interface service show
....
+
Services represent the applications accessed by a LIF as well as the applications served by the cluster. Each service includes zero or more TCP and UDP ports on which the application is listening.
+
The following additional data and management services are available:
+
....
network interface service show
Service                     Protocol:Ports

. Create a service policy:
+
....
network interface service-policy create -vserver <svm_name> -policy <service_policy_name> -services <service_name> -allowed-addresses <IP_address/mask,...>
....
+

* "service_name" specifies a list of services that should be included in the policy.
* "IP_address/mask" specifies the list of subnet masks for addresses that are allowed to access the services in the service policy. By default, all specified services are added with a default allowed address list of 0.0.0.0/0, which allows traffic from all subnets. When a non-default allowed address list is provided, LIFs using the policy are configured to block all requests with a source address that does not match any of the specified masks.
+
The following example shows how to create a data service policy, svm1_data_policy, for an SVM that includes NFS and SMB services:
+
....
network interface service-policy create -vserver svm1 -policy svm1_data_policy - services data-nfs,data-cifs,data-core -allowed-addresses 10.1.0.0/16
....
+
The following example shows how to create an intercluster service policy:
+
....
network interface service-policy create -vserver cluster1 -policy intercluster1 - services intercluster-core -allowed-addresses 10.1.0.0/16
....

. Verify that the service policy is created.
+
....
network interface service-policy show
....
+
The following output shows the service policies that are available:
+
....
network interface service-policy show

.After you finish

Assign the service policy to a LIF either at the time of creation or by modifying an existing LIF.

== Assign a service policy to a LIF

You can assign a service policy to a LIF either at the time of creating the LIF or by modifying the LIF. A service policy defines the list of services that can be used with the LIF.

.About this task

You can assign service policies for LIFs in the admin and data SVMs.

.Step

Depending on when you want to assign the service policy to a LIF, perform one of the following actions:

[cols="25,75"]
|===
|If you are... |Assign the service policy by entering the following command...

|Creating a LIF
|network interface create -vserver svm_name -lif <lif_name> -home-node <node_name> -home-port <port_name> {(-address <IP_address> -netmask <IP_address>) -subnet-name <subnet_name>} -service-policy <service_policy_name>
|Modifying a LIF
|network interface modify -vserver <svm_name> -lif <lif_name> -service-policy <service_policy_name>
|===

When you specify a service policy for a LIF, you need not specify the data protocol and role for the LIF. Creating LIFs by specifying the role and data protocols is also supported.

[NOTE]
A service policy can only be used by LIFs in the same SVM that you specified when creating the service policy.

=== Examples

The following example shows how to modify the service policy of a LIF to use the default- management service policy:

....
network interface modify -vserver cluster1 -lif lif1 -service-policy default-management
....

== Commands for managing LIF service policies

Use the `network interface service-policy` commands to manage LIF service policies.
