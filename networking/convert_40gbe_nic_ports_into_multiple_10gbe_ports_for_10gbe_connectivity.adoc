You can convert the X1144A-R6 and the X91440A-R6 40GbE Network Interface Cards (NICs) to support four 10GbE ports.

If you are connecting a hardware platform that supports one of these NICs to a cluster that supports 10GbE cluster interconnect and customer data connections, the NIC must be converted to provide the necessary 10GbE connections.

.Before you begin

You must be using a supported breakout cable.

.About this task

For a complete list of platforms that support NICs, see the https://hwu.netapp.com/[Hardware Universe^].

[NOTE]
On the X1144A-R6 NIC, only port A can be converted to support the four 10GbE connections. Once port A is converted, port e is not available for use.

.Steps

. Enter maintenance mode.
. Convert the NIC from 40GbE support to 10GbE support.

. After using the convert command, halt the node.
. Install or change the cable.
. Depending on the hardware model, use the SP (Service Processor) or BMC (Baseboard Management Controller) to power-cycle the node for the conversion to take effect.
