You can diagnose problems on your network by using commands such as `ping, traceroute, ndp,` and `tcpdump`. You can also use commands such as `ping6` and `traceroute6` to diagnose IPv6 problems.

|===

h|If you want to... h|Enter this command...

|Test whether the node can reach other hosts on your network
|`network ping`
|Test whether the node can reach other hosts on your IPv6 network
|`network ping6`
|Trace the route that the IPv4 packets take to a network node
|`network traceroute`
|Trace the route that the IPv6 packets take to a network node
|`network traceroute6`
|Manage the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)
|`network ndp`
|Display statistics about packets that are received and sent on a specified network interface or on all network interfaces
|`run -node _node_name_ ifstat`

*Note*: This command is available from the nodeshell.
|Display information about neighboring devices that are discovered from each node and port in the cluster, including the remote device type and device platform
|`network device-discovery show`
|View the CDP neighbors of the node (ONTAP supports only CDPv1 advertisements)
|`run -node _node_name_ cdpd show-neighbors`

*Note*: This command is available from the nodeshell.
|Trace the packets that are sent and received in the network
|`network tcpdump start -node _node-name_ -port _port_name_`

*Note*: This command is available from the nodeshell.
|Measure latency and throughput between intercluster or intracluster nodes
|`network test -path -source-node _source_nodename local_ -destination-cluster _destination_clustername_ -destination-node _destination_nodename_ -session-type _Default_, _AsyncMirrorLocal_, _AsyncMirrorRemote_, _SyncMirrorRemote_, or _RemoteDataTransfer_`
