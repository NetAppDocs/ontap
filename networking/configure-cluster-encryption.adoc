= Configure ONTAP backend cluster network encryption
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

Beginning with ONTAP 9.18.1, you can configure encryption for data-in-flight on the backend cluster network.

.About this task
* Encryption for cluster network communication is disabled by default. Once enabled, all data stored in ONTAP is encrypted when transmitted between ONTAP nodes in the cluster network. *[What is not encrypted??]*
* When encryption for cluster network communication is enabled, you must use `cluster add-node` to add new nodes to the cluster. You cannot use `cluster join` or the Cluster Setup Wizard from a new node when encryption is enabled. Learn more about `cluster add-node` in the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/cluster-add-node.html[ONTAP command reference^].

.Before you begin
* You must be an ONTAP administrator at the `admin` privilege level to perform the following tasks.
* All nodes in the cluster must be running ONTAP 9.18.1 or later to enable cluster network encryption.

== Enable or disable encryption for cluster network communication

.Steps

. View the current cluster network encryption status:
+
[source, cli]
----
security cluster-network show
----
This command shows the current status of cluster network encryption:
```
Cluster-1::*> security cluster-network show

Enabled: true

Mode: tls

Status: READY
```

. Enable or disable encryption for HA pair communication:
+
[source, cli]
----
security cluster-network modify -enabled <true|false>
----
This command enables or disables encrypted communication for data-in-flight on the backend cluster network.

== Manage cluster network encryption certificates
