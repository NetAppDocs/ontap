You can create static routes within a storage virtual machine (SVM) to control how LIFs use the network for outbound traffic.

When you create a route entry associated with an SVM, the route will be used by all LIFs that are owned by the specified SVM and that are on the same subnet as the gateway.

.Step

Use the `network route create` command to create a route.

....
network route create -vserver vs0 -destination 0.0.0.0/0 -gateway 10.61.208.1
