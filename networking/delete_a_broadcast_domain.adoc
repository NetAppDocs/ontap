If you no longer need a broadcast domain, you can delete it. This moves the ports associated with that broadcast domain to the "Default" IPspace.

.Before you begin

There must be no subnets, network interfaces, or SVMs associated with the broadcast domain you want to delete.

.About this task

* The system-created "Cluster" broadcast domain cannot be deleted.
* All failover groups related to the broadcast domain are removed when you delete the broadcast domain.

The procedure you follow depends on the interface that you use--System Manager or the CLI:

The delete option is not shown when the broadcast domain contains ports or is associated with a subnet.
