To modify the MTU setting for interface groups, you must modify the MTU of the broadcast domain.

VLAN MTU size should match the broadcast domain MTU of the underlying interface groups and physical ports. If a different VLAN setting is needed for a VLAN, it must not exceed the size specified by the underlying broadcast domain.

.Steps

. Modify the broadcast domain settings:
+
`broadcast-domain modify -broadcast-domain _broadcast_domain_name_ -mtu _mtu_setting_`
