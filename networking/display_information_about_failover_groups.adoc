You can view information about failover groups, including the list of nodes and ports in each failover group, whether failover is enabled or disabled, and the type of failover policy that is being applied to each LIF.

.Steps

. Display the target ports for each failover group by using the `network interface failover-groups show` command.
+
The following command displays information about all failover groups on a two-node cluster:
+
....
network interface failover-groups show
                              Failover
Vserver        Group          Targets

                              cluster1-01:e0a, cluster1-01:e0b,
                              cluster1-02:e0a, cluster1-02:e0b

               Default
                              cluster1-01:e0c, cluster1-01:e0d,
                              cluster1-01:e0e, cluster1-02:e0c,
                              cluster1-02:e0d, cluster1-02:e0e
....

. Display the target ports and broadcast domain for a specific failover group by using the `network interface failover-groups show` command.
+
The following command displays detailed information about failover group data12 for SVM vs4:
+
....
network interface failover-groups show -vserver vs4 -failover-group data12

       Vserver Name: vs4
Failover Group Name: data12
   Failover Targets: cluster1-01:e0f, cluster1-01:e0g, cluster1-02:e0f,
                     cluster1-02:e0g
   Broadcast Domain: Default
....

. Display the failover settings used by all LIFs by using the `network interface show` command.
+
The following command displays the failover policy and failover group that is being used by each LIF:
+
....
network interface show -vserver * -lif * -fields failover-group,failover-policy
vserver   lif                 failover-policy        failover-group
