[.lead]
You can view detailed information about a LIF to determine its configuration.

You might also want to view this information to diagnose basic LIF problems, such as checking for duplicate IP addresses or verifying whether the network port belongs to the correct subnet. storage virtual machine (SVM) administrators can view only the information about the LIFs associated with the SVM.

.About this task

The following information is displayed:

* IP address associated with the LIF
* Administrative status of the LIF
* Operational status of the LIF
+
The operational status of data LIFs is determined by the status of the SVM with which the data LIFs are associated. When the SVM is stopped, the operational status of the LIF changes to down. When the SVM is started again, the operational status changes to up

* Node and the port on which the LIF resides

If data for a field is not available (for example, if there is no extended status information), the field value is listed as `-`.

.Step

Display LIF information by using the network interface show command.

You can view detailed information for each LIF by specifying the -instance parameter, or get specific information by specifying field names using the -fields parameter.

The following command displays general information about all LIFs in a cluster:
