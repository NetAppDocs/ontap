Broadcast domains are automatically created during the cluster create or join operation. You do not need to manually remove ports from broadcast domains.

If network port reachability has changed, either through physical network connectivity or switch configuration, and a network port belongs in a different broadcast domain, see the following topic:

.System Manager
--
Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can use System Manager to reassign Ethernet ports across broadcast domains. It is recommended that you assign every Ethernet port to a broadcast domain. So, if you unassign an Ethernet port from a broadcast domain, you must reassign it to a different broadcast domain.

.Steps

To reassign Ethernet ports, perform the following steps:

. Select *Network > Overview*.

. In the *Broadcast Domains* section, select image:icon_kabob.gif[menu icon] next to the domain name.

. In the drop-down menu, select *Edit*.

. On the *Edit Broadcast Domain* page, deselect the Ethernet ports that you want to reassign to another domain.

. For each deselected port, the *Reassign Ethernet Port* window displays. Select the broadcast domain to which you want to reassign the port, and then select *Reassign*.

. Select all the ports that you want to assign to the current broadcast domain and save your changes.

If network port reachability has changed, either through physical network connectivity or switch configuration, and a network port belongs in a different broadcast domain, see the following topic:

link:repair_port_reachability.html[Repair port reachability]

Alternately, you can manually add or remove ports from broadcast domains using the `network port broadcast-domain add-ports` or the `network port broadcast-domain remove-ports` command.

.Before you begin

* You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.
* Ports you plan to add to a broadcast domain must not belong to another broadcast domain.
* Ports that already belong to an interface group cannot be added individually to a broadcast domain.

.About this task

The following rules apply when adding and removing network ports:

|===

h| When adding ports... h| When removing ports...

| The ports can be network ports, VLANs, or interface groups (ifgrps).
| N/A
| The ports are added to the system-defined failover group of the broadcast domain.
| The ports are removed from all failover groups in the broadcast domain.
| The MTU of the ports is updated to the MTU value set in the broadcast domain.
| The MTU of the ports is unchanged.
| The IPspace of the ports is updated to the IPspace value of the broadcast domain.
| The ports are moved to the 'Default' IPspace with no broadcast domain attribute.
|===

[NOTE]
If you remove the last member port of an interface group using the `network port ifgrp remove-port` command, it causes the interface group port to be removed from the broadcast domain because an empty interface group port is not allowed in a broadcast domain.

.Steps

. Display the ports that are currently assigned or unassigned to a broadcast domain by using the `network port show` command.
. Add or remove network ports from the broadcast domain:

h| If you want to... h| Use...

a| Add ports to a broadcast domain
a| `network port broadcast-domain add-ports`
a| Remove ports from a broadcast domain
a| `network port broadcast-domain remove-ports`
|===

. Verify that the ports were added or removed from the broadcast domain:
+
`network port show`

For more information about these commands, see the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli[ONTAP command reference^]

.Examples of adding and removing ports

The following command adds port e0g on node cluster-1-01 and port e0g on node cluster-1-02 to broadcast domain bcast1 in the Default IPspace:

`cluster-1::> network port broadcast-domain add-ports -broadcast-domain bcast1 -ports cluster-1-01:e0g,cluster1-02:e0g`

The following command adds two cluster ports to broadcast domain Cluster in the Cluster IPspace:

`cluster-1::> network port broadcast-domain add-ports -broadcast-domain Cluster -ports cluster-2-03:e0f,cluster2-04:e0f -ipspace Cluster`

The following command removes port e0e on node cluster1-01 from broadcast domain bcast1 in the Default IPspace:

`cluster-1::> network port broadcast-domain remove-ports -broadcast-domain bcast1 -ports cluster-1-01:e0e`
