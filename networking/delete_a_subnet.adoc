If you no longer need a subnet and want to deallocate the IP addresses that were assigned to the subnet, you can delete it.

The procedure you follow depends on the interface that you use--System Manager or the CLI:

[role="tabbed-block"]
====
.System Manager
--
*Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.0, you can use System Manager to delete a subnet*

.Steps

. Select *Network > Overview > Subnets*.

. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[kebob icon] *> Delete* beside the subnet you want to remove.

. Save your changes.

--

.CLI
--
*Use the CLI to delete a subnet*

.About this task

You will receive an error if any service processor or network interfaces are currently using IP addresses in the specified ranges. If you want the interfaces to continue to use the IP addresses even after the subnet is deleted, you can set the -force-update-lif-associations option to true to remove the subnet's association with the LIFs.

.Step

Delete a subnet:

`network subnet delete -subnet-name subnet_name [-ipspace ipspace_name] [-force-update-lif- associations true]`

The following command deletes subnet sub1 in IPspace ipspace1:

`network subnet delete -subnet-name sub1 -ipspace ipspace1`
