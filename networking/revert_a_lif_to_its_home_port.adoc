You can revert a LIF to its home port after it fails over or is migrated to a different port either manually or automatically. If the home port of a particular LIF is unavailable, the LIF remains at its current port and is not reverted.

.About this task

* If you administratively bring the home port of a LIF to the up state before setting the automatic revert option, the LIF is not returned to the home port.
* The LIF does not automatically revert unless the value of the "auto-revert" option is set to true.
* You must ensure that the "auto-revert" option is enabled for the LIFs to revert to their home ports.
