If you are already familiar with basic networking concepts, you might be able to save time setting up your network by reviewing this "hands on" workflow for NAS path failover configuration.

[NOTE]
The workflow for configuring NAS path failover is different in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier versions. If you need to configure NAS failover on a network running ONTAP 9.7 and earlier, refer to the workflow link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-system-manager-classic/networking-failover/workflow__nas_path_failover_overview_manual.html[NAS path failover workflow (ONTAP 9.7 and earlier)^]. 

A NAS LIF automatically migrates to a surviving network port after a link failure on its current port. You can rely on the ONTAP defaults to manage path failover.

[NOTE]
A SAN LIF does not migrate (unless you move it manually after the link failure). Instead, multipathing technology on the host diverts traffic to a different LIF. For more information, see link:../san-admin/index.html[SAN administration^].
