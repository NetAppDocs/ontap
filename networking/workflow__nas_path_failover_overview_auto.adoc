If you are already familiar with basic networking concepts, you might be able to save time setting up your network by reviewing this "hands on" workflow for NAS path failover configuration.

A NAS LIF automatically migrates to a surviving network port after a link failure on its current port. You can rely on the ONTAP defaults to manage path failover.

[NOTE]
A SAN LIF does not migrate (unless you move it manually after the link failure). Instead, multipathing technology on the host diverts traffic to a different LIF. For more information, see link:../san-admin/index.html[SAN administration^].
