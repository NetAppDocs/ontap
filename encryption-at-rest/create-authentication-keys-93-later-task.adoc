[.lead]
You can use the `security key-manager create-key` command to create the authentication keys for a node and store them on the configured KMIP servers.

.About this task

If your security setup requires you to use different keys for data authentication and FIPS 140-2 authentication, you should create a separate key for each. If that is not the case, you can use the same authentication key for FIPS compliance that you use for data access.

ONTAP creates authentication keys for all nodes in the cluster.

* This command is not supported when onboard key management is enabled.
* You receive a warning if the configured key management servers are already storing more than 128 authentication keys.
+
You can use the key management server software to delete any unused keys, then run the command again.

.Before you begin

You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.

.Steps

. Create the authentication keys for cluster nodes:
+
`security key-manager create-key`
+
Learn more about `security key-manager create-key` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/security-key-manager-key-create.html[ONTAP command reference^].
+
[NOTE]
The key ID displayed in the output is an identifier used to refer to the authentication key. It is not the actual authentication key or the data encryption key.
+
The following example creates the authentication keys for `cluster1`:
+
----
cluster1::> security key-manager create-key
   (security key-manager create-key)
Verifying requirements...

Node: cluster1-01
Creating authentication key...
Authentication key creation successful.
Key ID: <id_value>

Node: cluster1-01
Key manager restore operation initialized.
Successfully restored key information.

Node: cluster1-02
Key manager restore operation initialized.
Successfully restored key information.
----

. Verify that the authentication keys have been created:
+
`security key-manager query`
+
Learn more about `security key-manager query` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/security-key-manager-key-query.html[ONTAP command reference^].
+
The following example verifies that authentication keys have been created for `cluster1`:
+
----
cluster1::> security key-manager query

  (security key-manager query)
