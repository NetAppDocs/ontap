[.lead]
You can use one or more KMIP servers to secure the keys the cluster uses to access encrypted data. Beginning with ONTAP 9.6, you have the option to configure a separate external key manager to secure the keys that a data SVM uses to access encrypted data.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, you can add up to 3 secondary key servers per primary key server to create a clustered key server. For more information, see xref:configure-cluster-key-server-task.html[Configure clustered external key servers].

.About this task

You can connect up to four KMIP servers to a cluster or SVM. A minimum of two servers is recommended for redundancy and disaster recovery.

The scope of external key management determines whether key management servers secure all the SVMs in the cluster or selected SVMs only:

* You can use a _cluster scope_ to configure external key management for all the SVMs in the cluster. The cluster administrator has access to every key stored on the servers.
* Beginning with ONTAP 9.6, you can use an _SVM scope_ to configure external key management for a data SVM in the cluster. That's best for multitenant environments in which each tenant uses a different SVM (or set of SVMs) to serve data. Only the SVM administrator for a given tenant has access to the keys for that tenant.
* For multitenant environments, install a license for _MT_EK_MGMT_ by using the following command:
+
`system license add -license-code <MT_EK_MGMT license code>`
+
Learn more about `system license add` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/system-license-add.html[ONTAP command reference^].

You can use both scopes in the same cluster. If key management servers have been configured for an SVM, ONTAP uses only those servers to secure keys. Otherwise, ONTAP secures keys with the key management servers configured for the cluster.

You can configure onboard key management at the cluster scope and external key management at the SVM scope. You can use the `security key-manager key migrate` command to migrate keys from onboard key management at the cluster scope to external key managers at the SVM scope.

.Before you begin

* The KMIP SSL client and server certificates must have been installed.
* You must be a cluster or SVM administrator to perform this task.
* If you want to enable external key management for a MetroCluster environment, MetroCluster must be fully configured before enabling external key management.
* In a MetroCluster environment, you must install the same KMIP SSL certificate on both clusters.

.Steps

. Configure key manager connectivity for the cluster:
+
`security key-manager external enable -vserver admin_SVM -key-servers host_name|IP_address:port,... -client-cert client_certificate -server-ca-cert server_CA_certificates`
+
[NOTE]
====
* The `security key-manager external enable` command replaces the `security key-manager setup` command. If you run the command at the cluster login prompt, `_admin_SVM_` defaults to the admin SVM of the current cluster.  You must be the cluster administrator to configure cluster scope. You can run the `security key-manager external modify` command to change the external key management configuration.

* In a MetroCluster environment, if you are configuring external key management for the admin SVM, you must repeat the `security key-manager external enable` command on the partner cluster.

The following command enables external key management for `cluster1` with three external key servers. The first key server is specified using its hostname and port, the second is specified using an IP address and the default port, and the third is specified using an IPv6 address and port:
+
----
clusterl::> security key-manager external enable -vserver cluster1 -key-servers ks1.local:15696,10.0.0.10,[fd20:8b1e:b255:814e:32bd:f35c:832c:5a09]:1234 -client-cert AdminVserverClientCert -server-ca-certs AdminVserverServerCaCert
----

. Configure a key manager an SVM:
+
`security key-manager external enable -vserver SVM -key-servers host_name|IP_address:port,... -client-cert client_certificate -server-ca-cert server_CA_certificates`
+
[NOTE]
====
* If you run the command at the SVM login prompt, `SVM` defaults to the current SVM.  You must be a cluster or SVM administrator to configure SVM scope. You can run the `security key-manager external modify` command to change the external key management configuration.

* In a MetroCluster environment, if you are configuring external key management for a data SVM, you do not have to repeat the `security key-manager external enable` command on the partner cluster. 
====
+
The following command enables external key management for `svm1` with a single key server listening on the default port 5696:
+
----
svm1l::> security key-manager external enable -vserver svm1 -key-servers keyserver.svm1.com -client-cert SVM1ClientCert -server-ca-certs SVM1ServerCaCert
----

. Repeat the last step for any additional SVMs.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can also use the `security key-manager external add-servers` command to configure additional SVMs. The `security key-manager external add-servers` command replaces the `security key-manager add` command. 
Learn more about `security key-manager external add-servers` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/security-key-manager-external-add-servers.html[ONTAP command reference^].
====

. Verify that all configured KMIP servers are connected:
+
`security key-manager external show-status -node node_name`
+
[NOTE]
====
The `security key-manager external show-status` command replaces the `security key-manager show -status` command. 
Learn more about `security key-manager external show-status` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/security-key-manager-external-show-status.html[ONTAP command reference^].

. Optionally, convert plain text volumes to encrypted volumes.
+
`volume encryption conversion start`
+
An external key manager must be fully configured before you convert the volumes. In a MetroCluster environment, an external key manager must be configured on both sites.
