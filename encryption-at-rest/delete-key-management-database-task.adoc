[.lead]
If you want to switch to onboard key management from external key management, you must delete the external key management configuration before you can enable onboard key management.

.Before you begin

* For hardware-based encryption, you must reset the data keys of all FIPS drives or SEDs to the default value.

* You must have deleted all external key manager connections.

* You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.

.Steps

The steps to transition your key management depend on the version of ONTAP you are using.
