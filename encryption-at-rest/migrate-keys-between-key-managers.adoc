[.lead]
You can manage your data encryption keys using either the ONTAP onboard key manager or an external key manager (or both). External key managers can only be enabled at the storage VM level. At the ONTAP cluster level, you can enable either the onboard key manager or an external key manager.

== Migrate keys between key managers at the ONTAP cluster level
Beginning in ONTAP 9.16.1 you can use the ONTAP CLI to migrate keys between key managers at the cluster level.

== Migrate keys between key managers across ONTAP cluster and storage VM levels

You can use the ONTAP command line interface (CLI) to migrate keys between the key manager at the cluster level and a key manager at the storage VM level.  


.Steps

. Set the privilege level to advanced:
+
[source, cli]
----
set -privilege advance
----

. Migrate the keys:
+
[source, cli]
----
security key-manager key migrate -from-vserver SVM -to-vserver SVM
----

. Set the privilege level to admin:
+
[source, cli]
----
set -privilege admin
