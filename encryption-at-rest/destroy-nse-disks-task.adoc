[.lead]
If you want to make data on a FIPS drive or SED permanently inaccessible and you do not need to reuse the drive, you can use the `storage encryption disk destroy` command to destroy the disk.

.About this task

When you destroy a FIPS drive or SED, the system sets the disk encryption key to an unknown random value and locks the drive irreversibly. Doing so renders the disk virtually unusable and the data on it permanently inaccessible. However, you can reset the disk to its factory-configured settings using the physical secure ID (PSID) printed on the disk's label. For more information, see link:return-self-encrypting-disks-keys-not-available-task.html[Returning a FIPS drive or SED to service when authentication keys are lost].

[NOTE]
You should not destroy a FIPS drive or SED unless you have the Non-Returnable Disk Plus service (NRD Plus). Destroying a disk voids its warranty.

.Before you begin

You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.

.Steps

. Migrate any data that needs to be preserved to an aggregate on another different disk.
. Delete the aggregate on the FIPS drive or SED to be destroyed:
+
`storage aggregate delete -aggregate aggregate_name`
+

cluster1::> storage aggregate delete -aggregate aggr1
----

. Identify the disk ID for the FIPS drive or SED to be destroyed:
+
`storage encryption disk show`
+

Warning: This operation will cryptographically destroy 1 spare or broken
         self-encrypting disks on 1 node.
         You cannot reuse destroyed disks unless you revert
         them to their original state using the PSID value.
         To continue, enter
          destroy disk
         :destroy disk

Info: Starting destroy on 1 disk.
      View the status of the operation by using the
