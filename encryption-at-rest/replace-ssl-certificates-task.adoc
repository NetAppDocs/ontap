[.lead]
All SSL certificates have an expiration date. You must update your certificates before they expire to prevent loss of access to authentication keys.

.What you'll need

* You must have obtained the replacement public and private certificates for the cluster.
* You must have obtained the replacement public certificate for the KMIP server.
* You must be a cluster or SVM administrator to perform this task.

[NOTE]
====
You can install the replacement client and server certificates on the KMIP server before or after installing the certificates on the cluster.
====

.Steps

. Install the new KMIP server-ca certificate:
+
`security certificate install -type server-ca -vserver <>``
. Install the new KMIP client certificate:
+
`security certificate install -type client -vserver <>`
. Update the key manager configuration to use the newly installed certificates:
+
`security key-manager external modify -vserver <> -client-cert <> -server-ca-certs <>`
+
[NOTE]
====
Updating the key manager configuration to use the newly installed certificates will return an error if the public/private keys of the new client certificate are different from the keys previously configured. Contact NetApp support for instructions on how to override this error.
