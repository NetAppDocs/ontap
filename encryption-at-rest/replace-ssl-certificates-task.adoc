[.lead]
All SSL certificates have an expiration date. You must update your certificates before they expire to prevent loss of access to authentication keys.

.Before you begin

* You must have obtained the replacement public certificate and private key for the cluster (KMIP client certificate).
* You must have obtained the replacement public certificate for the KMIP server (KMIP server-ca certificate).
* You must be a cluster or SVM administrator to perform this task.
* If you are replacing the KMIP SSL certificates in a MetroCluster environment, you must install the same replacement KMIP SSL certificate on both clusters. 


[NOTE]
You can install the replacement client and server certificates on the KMIP server before or after installing the certificates on the cluster.

.Steps

. Install the new KMIP server-ca certificate:
+
`security certificate install -type server-ca -vserver <>`
. Install the new KMIP client certificate:
+
`security certificate install -type client -vserver <>`
. Update the key manager configuration to use the newly installed certificates:
+
`security key-manager external modify -vserver <> -client-cert <> -server-ca-certs <>`
+
If you are running ONTAP 9.6 or later in a MetroCluster environment, and you want to modify the key manager configuration on the admin SVM, you must run the command on both clusters in the configuration.

[NOTE]
Updating the key manager configuration to use the newly installed certificates will return an error if the public/private keys of the new client certificate are different from the keys previously installed. See the Knowledge Base article link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Storage_Software/ONTAP_OS/The_new_client_certificate_public_or_private_keys_are_different_from_the_existing_client_certificate[The new client certificate public or private keys are different from the existing client certificate^] for instructions on how to override this error.
