Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can use NetApp Volume Encryption to protect the root volume of your node.

.About this task

[NOTE]
This procedure applies to the node root volume. It does not apply to SVM root volumes. SVM root volumes can be protected through aggregate-level encryption and, xref:configure-nve-svm-root-task.html[beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, NVE]. 

Once root volume encryption begins, it must complete. You cannot pause the operation. Once encryption is complete, you cannot assign a new key to the root volume and you cannot perform a secure-purge operation.

.Before you begin

* Your system must be using an HA configuration.
* Your node root volume must already be created.
* Your system must have an onboard key manager or an external key management server using the Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP).

.Steps

. Encrypt the root volume:
+
`volume encryption conversion start -vserver _SVM_name_ -volume _root_vol_name_`
. Verify the status of the conversion operation:
+
`volume encryption conversion show`
. When the conversion operation is complete, verify that the volume is encrypted:
+
`volume show -fields`
+
The following shows example output for an encrypted volume.

----
::> volume show -vserver xyz  -volume vol0 -fields is-encrypted
vserver    volume is-encrypted
---------- ------ ------------
xyz        vol0   true
