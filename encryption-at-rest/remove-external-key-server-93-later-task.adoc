[.lead]
You can disconnect a KMIP server from a node when you no longer need the server. For example, you might disconnect a KMIP server when you are transitioning to volume encryption.

.About this task

When you disconnect a KMIP server from one node in an HA pair, the system automatically disconnects the server from all cluster nodes.

[NOTE]
If you plan to continue using external key management after disconnecting a KMIP server, make sure another KMIP server is available to serve authentication keys.

.Before you begin

You must be a cluster or SVM administrator to perform this task.

.Step

. Disconnect a KMIP server from the current node:
