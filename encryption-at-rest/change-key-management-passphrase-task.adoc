[.lead]
Change the onboard key management passphrase regularly. Store the new passphrase in a secure location outside the storage system.


.Before you begin

* You must be a cluster or SVM administrator to perform this task.
* Advanced privileges are required for this task.
* If you are administering an ONTAP MetroCluster environment, you must update the passphrase on both clusters.

.Steps

. Change to advanced privilege level:
+
`set -privilege advanced`
. Change the onboard key management passphrase:
+
[cols="25,75"]
|===

h| For this ONTAP version... h| Use this command...

a|
ONTAP 9.6 and later
a|
`security key-manager onboard update-passphrase`
a|
ONTAP 9.5 and earlier
a|
`security key-manager update-passphrase`
|===

. Enter a passphrase between 32 and 256 characters, or for "`cc-mode`", a passphrase between 64 and 256 characters.
+
If the specified "`cc-mode`" passphrase is less than 64 characters, there is a five-second delay before the key manager setup operation displays the passphrase prompt again.

. At the passphrase confirmation prompt, reenter the passphrase.
. If you are in a MetroCluster configuration, perform the following steps to synchronize the configuration on the partner cluster:
..  Run the following command on the partner cluster:
+
`security key-manager onboard sync`
.. Enter the new passphrase when prompted.
+
The same passphrase must be used on both clusters.

.After you finish
You should copy the onboard key management passphrase to a secure location outside the storage system for future use.

You should back up key management information manually whenever you change the onboard key management passphrase.
