NetApp recommends that you change the onboard key management passphrase regularly. You must store the new passphrase in a secure location outside the storage system.


.Before you begin

* You must be a cluster or SVM administrator to perform this task.
* Advanced privileges are required for this task.
* If you are administering an ONTAP MetroCluster environment, after you update the passphrase on the local cluster, you synchronize the passphrase update on the partner cluster.

.Steps

. Change to advanced privilege level:
+
`set -privilege advanced`
. Change the onboard key management passphrase. The command you use depends on the ONTAP version you are running.
+
[role="tabbed-block"]
====

.ONTAP 9.6 and later
--

`security key-manager onboard update-passphrase`
--
.ONTAP 9.5 and earlier
--

`security key-manager update-passphrase`
--
====

. Enter a passphrase between 32 and 256 characters, or for "`cc-mode`", a passphrase between 64 and 256 characters.
+
If the specified "`cc-mode`" passphrase is less than 64 characters, there is a five-second delay before the key manager setup operation displays the passphrase prompt again.

. At the passphrase confirmation prompt, reenter the passphrase.
. If you are in a MetroCluster configuration, synchronize the updated passphrase on the partner cluster.
+
.. Synchronize the passphrase on the partner cluster by choosing the correct command for your ONTAP version:
+
[role="tabbed-block"]
====

.ONTAP 9.6 and later
--

`security key-manager onboard sync`
--
.ONTAP 9.5 and earlier
--
* In ONTAP 9.5, run:
+
`security key-manager setup -sync-metrocluster-config`

* In ONTAP 9.4 and earlier, after you've updated the passphrase on the local cluster, wait 20 seconds, and then run the following command on the partner cluster:
+
`security key-manager setup`
--
====

.. Enter the new passphrase when prompted.
+
The same passphrase must be used on both clusters.

.After you finish
Copy the onboard key management passphrase to a secure location outside the storage system for future use.

Back up key management information manually whenever you change the onboard key management passphrase.
