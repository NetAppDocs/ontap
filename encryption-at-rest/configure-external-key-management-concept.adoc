You can use one or more external key management servers to secure the keys that the cluster uses to access encrypted data. An external key management server is a third-party system in your storage environment that serves keys to nodes using the Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP).

NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE) can be implemented with Onboard Key Manager. In ONTAP 9.3 and later, NVE can be implemented with external key management (KMIP) and Onboard Key Manager. Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, you can configure multiple external key managers in a cluster. See xref:configure-cluster-key-server-task.html[Configure clustered key servers.]
