You can use one or more external key management servers to secure the keys that the cluster uses to access encrypted data. An external key management server is a third-party system in your storage environment that serves keys to nodes using the Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP). In addition to the Onboard Key Manager, ONTAP supports several external key management servers.

See xref:configure-cluster-key-server-task.html[Configure clustered key servers].
