[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can use a secure purge to non-disruptively "`scrub`" data on NVE-enabled volumes with an SnapMirror asynchronous relationship.

.Before you begin

* You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.
* Advanced privileges are required for this task.

.About this task

Secure-purge may take from several minutes to many hours to complete, depending on the amount of data in the deleted files. You can use the `volume encryption secure-purge show` command to view the status of the operation. You can use the `volume encryption secure-purge abort` command to terminate the operation.

[NOTE]
In order to do a secure purge on a SAN host, you must delete the entire LUN containing the files you want to purge, or you must be able to punch holes in the LUN for the blocks that belong to the files you want purge. If you cannot delete the LUN or your host operating system does not support punching holes in the LUN, you cannot perform a secure purge.

.Steps

. On the storage system, switch to the advanced privilege level:
+
`set -privilege advanced`
. Delete the files or the LUN you want to securely purge.
 ** On a NAS client, delete the files you want to securely purge.
 ** On a SAN host, delete the LUN you want to securely purge or punch holes in the LUN for the blocks that belong to the files you want to purge.
. Prepare the destination volume in the Asynchronous relationship to be securely purged:
+
`volume encryption secure-purge start -vserver _SVM_name_ -volume _volume_name_ -prepare true`
+
Repeat this step on each volume in your SnapMirror asynchronous relationship.

. If the files you want to securely purge are in snapshots, delete the snapshots:
+
`snapshot delete -vserver _SVM_name_ -volume _volume_name_ -snapshot`
. If the files you want to securely purge are in the base snapshots, do the following:
.. Create a snapshot on the destination volume in the SnapMirror asynchronous relationship:
+
`volume snapshot create -snapshot snapshot_name -vserver _SVM_name_ -volume _volume_name_`
.. Update SnapMirror to move the base snapshot forward:
+
`snapmirror update -source-snapshot _snapshot_name_ -destination-path _destination_path_`
+
Repeat this step for each volume in the SnapMirror asynchronous relationship.

.. Repeat steps (a) and (b) equal to the number of base snapshots plus one.
+
For example, if you have two base snapshots, you should repeat steps (a) and (b) three times.

.. Verify that the base snapshot is present:
 +
`snapshot show -vserver _SVM_name_ -volume _volume_name_`
.. Delete the base snapshot:
 +
`snapshot delete -vserver _svm_name_ -volume _volume_name_ -snapshot snapshot`
. Securely purge the deleted files:
+
`volume encryption secure-purge start -vserver _svm_name_ -volume _volume_name_`
+
Repeat this step on each volume in the SnapMirror asynchronous relationship.
+
The following command securely purges the deleted files on "`vol1`" on SVM "`vs1`":
+
----
cluster1::> volume encryption secure-purge start -vserver vs1 -volume vol1

. Verify the status of the secure purge operation:
+
`volume encryption secure-purge show`
