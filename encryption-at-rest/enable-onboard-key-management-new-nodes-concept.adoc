You can use the Onboard Key Manager to secure the keys that the cluster uses to access encrypted data. You must enable Onboard Key Manager on each cluster that accesses an encrypted volume or a self-encrypting disk.

[NOTE]
====
For ONTAP 9.6 and later, you must run the `security key-manager onboard sync` command each time you add a node to the cluster.

For ONTAP 9.5 and earlier, you must run the `security key-manager setup` command each time you add a node to the cluster.

If you add a node to a cluster with onboard key management, run this command to refresh missing keys.
====

If you have a MetroCluster configuration, review these guidelines:

* Beginning with ONTAP 9.6, you must run `security key-manager onboard enable` on the local cluster first, then run `security key-manager onboard sync` on the remote cluster, using the same passphrase on each.
+
Learn more about `security key-manager onboard enable` and `security key-manager onboard sync` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/search.html?q=security+key-manager+onboard[ONTAP command reference^].
* In ONTAP 9.5, you must run `security key-manager setup` on the local cluster and `security key-manager setup -sync-metrocluster-config yes` on the remote cluster, using the same passphrase on each.
* Prior to ONTAP 9.5, you must run `security key-manager setup` on the local cluster, wait approximately 20 seconds, and then run `security key-manager setup` on the remote cluster, using the same passphrase on each.

By default, you are not required to enter the key manager passphrase when a node is rebooted. Beginning with ONTAP 9.4, you can use the `-enable-cc-mode yes` option to require that users enter the passphrase after a reboot.

For NVE, if you set `-enable-cc-mode yes`, volumes you create with the `volume create` and `volume move start` commands are automatically encrypted. For `volume create`, you need not specify `-encrypt true`. For `volume move start`, you need not specify `-encrypt-destination true`.

[NOTE]
====
If the passphrase attempt fails, reboot the node. After the reboot, you can try entering the passphrase again.
