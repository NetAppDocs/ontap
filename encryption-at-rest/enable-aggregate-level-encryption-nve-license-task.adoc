[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.7, newly created aggregates and volumes are encrypted by default when you have the link:../encryption-at-rest/install-license-task.html[VE license] and onboard or external key management. Beginning with ONTAP 9.6, you can use aggregate-level encryption to assign keys to the containing aggregate for the volumes to be encrypted.

.About this task

You must use aggregate-level encryption if you plan to perform inline or background aggregate-level deduplication. Aggregate-level deduplication is otherwise not supported by NVE.

An aggregate enabled for aggregate-level encryption is called an _NAE aggregate_ (for NetApp Aggregate Encryption). All volumes in an NAE aggregate must be encrypted with NAE or NVE encryption. With aggregate-level encryption, volumes you create in the aggregate are encrypted with NAE encryption by default. You can override the default to use NVE encryption instead.

Plain text volumes are not supported in NAE aggregates.

.Before you begin

You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.

h| To... h| Use this command...

a|
Create an NAE aggregate with ONTAP 9.7 or later
a|
`storage aggregate create -aggregate _aggregate_name_ -node _node_name_`
a|
Create an NAE aggregate with ONTAP 9.6
a|
`storage aggregate create -aggregate _aggregate_name_ -node _node_name_ -encrypt-with-aggr-key true`
a|
Convert a non-NAE aggregate to an NAE aggregate
a|
`storage aggregate modify -aggregate _aggregate_name_ -node _node_name_ -encrypt-with-aggr-key true`
a|
Convert an NAE aggregate to a non-NAE aggregate

`storage aggregate modify -aggregate _aggregate_name_ -node _node_name_ -encrypt-with-aggr-key false`

The following command enables aggregate-level encryption on `aggr1`:

 ** ONTAP 9.7 or later:
+
----
cluster1::> storage aggregate create -aggregate aggr1
----

 ** ONTAP 9.6 or earlier:
+
----
cluster1::> storage aggregate create -aggregate aggr1 -encrypt-with-aggr-key true
----

. Verify that the aggregate is enabled for encryption:
+
`storage aggregate show -fields encrypt-with-aggr-key`
+
Learn more about `storage aggregate show` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/storage-aggregate-show.html?q=storage+aggregate+show[ONTAP command reference^].
+
The following command verifies that `aggr1` is enabled for encryption:
+
----
cluster1::> storage aggregate show -fields encrypt-with-aggr-key
aggregate            encrypt-aggr-key
-------------------- ----------------
aggr0_vsim4          false
aggr1                true
2 entries were displayed.
----

.After you finish

Run the `volume create` command to create the encrypted volumes.

If you are using a KMIP server to store the encryption keys for a node, ONTAP automatically "`pushes`" an encryption key to the server when you encrypt a volume.
