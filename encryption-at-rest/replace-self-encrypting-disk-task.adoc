You can replace a FIPS drive or SED the same way you replace an ordinary disk. Make sure to assign new data authentication keys to the replacement drive. For a FIPS drive, you may also want to assign a new FIPS 140-2 authentication key.

.Before you begin

* You must know the key ID for the authentication key used by the drive.
* You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.

.Steps

. Ensure that the disk has been marked as failed:
+
`storage disk show -broken`
+

. Remove the failed disk and replace it with a new FIPS drive or SED, following the instructions in the hardware guide for your disk shelf model.
. Assign ownership of the newly replaced disk:
+
`storage disk assign -disk disk_name -owner node`
+
