[.lead]
You can use the `volume move` command to encrypt an existing volume, move an encrypted volume, or unencrypt a volume. Cluster administrators can run `volume move` command themselves, or they can delegate the authority to run the command to SVM administrators.

.About this task

By default, SVM administrators are assigned the `vsadmin` role, which does not include the authority to move volumes. You must assign the `vsadmin-volume` role to SVM administrators to enable them to run the `volume move` command.

.Step

. Delegate authority to run the `volume move` command:
+
`security login modify -vserver SVM_name -user-or-group-name user_or_group_name -application application -authmethod authentication_method -role vsadmin-volume`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page for the command.
+
The following command grants the SVM administrator authority to run the `volume move` command.
