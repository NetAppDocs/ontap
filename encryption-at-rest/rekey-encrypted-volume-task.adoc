It is a security best practice to change the encryption key for a volume periodically. Beginning with ONTAP 9.3, you can use the `volume encryption rekey start` command to change the encryption key.

.About this task

Once you start a rekey operation, it must complete. There is no returning to the old key. If you encounter a performance issue during the operation, you can run the `volume encryption rekey pause` command to pause the operation, and the `volume encryption rekey resume` command to resume the operation.

Until the rekey operation finishes, the volume will have two keys. New writes and their corresponding reads will use the new key. Otherwise, reads will use the old key.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot use `volume encryption rekey start` to rekey a SnapLock volume.

.Steps

. Change an encryption key:
+
`volume encryption rekey start -vserver SVM_name -volume volume_name`
+
The following command changes the encryption key for `vol1` on SVM``vs1``:
+
----
cluster1::> volume encryption rekey start -vserver vs1 -volume vol1
----

. Verify the status of the rekey operation:
+
`volume encryption rekey show`
+
Learn more about `volume encryption rekey show` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/volume-encryption-rekey-show.html[ONTAP command reference^].
+
The following command displays the status of the rekey operation:
+
----
cluster1::> volume encryption rekey show

Vserver   Volume   Start Time           Status
-------   ------   ------------------   ---------------------------
vs1       vol1     9/18/2017 17:51:41   Phase 2 of 2 is in progress.
----

. When the rekey operation is complete, verify that the volume is enabled for encryption:
+
`volume show -is-encrypted true`
+
Learn more about `volume show` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/volume-show.html[ONTAP command reference^].
+
The following command displays the encrypted volumes on `cluster1`:
+
----
cluster1::> volume show -is-encrypted true

Vserver  Volume  Aggregate  State  Type  Size  Available  Used
-------  ------  ---------  -----  ----  -----  --------- ----
vs1      vol1    aggr2     online    RW  200GB    160.0GB  20%
