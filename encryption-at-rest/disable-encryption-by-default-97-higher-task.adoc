[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.7, aggregate and volume encryption is enabled by default if you have a volume encryption (VE) license and use an onboard or external key manager. If necessary, you can disable encryption by default for the entire cluster.

.Before you begin

You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task, or an SVM administrator to whom the cluster administrator has delegated authority.

.Step

. To disable encryption by default for the entire cluster in ONTAP 9.7 or later, run the following command:
+
`options -option-name encryption.data_at_rest_encryption.disable_by_default -option-value on`
