= Assign a FIPS 140-2 authentication key to a FIPS drive

:icons: font

[.lead]
You can use the `storage encryption disk modify` command with the `-fips-key-id` option to assign a FIPS 140-2 authentication key to a FIPS drive. Cluster nodes use this key for drive operations other than data access, such as preventing denial-of-service attacks on the drive.

.What you'll need

The drive firmware must support FIPS 140-2 compliance. The https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool] contains information about supported drive firmware versions.

.About this task

Your security setup may require you to use different keys for data authentication and FIPS 140-2 authentication. If that is not the case, you can use the same authentication key for FIPS compliance that you use for data access.

.Steps

. Assign a FIPS 140-2 authentication key to SEDs:
+
`storage encryption disk modify -disk disk_id -fips-key-id fips_authentication_key_id`
+
You can use the `security key-manager query` command to view key IDs.

. Verify that the authentication key has been assigned:
+
`storage encryption disk show -fips`
