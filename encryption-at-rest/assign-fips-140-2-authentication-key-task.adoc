= Assign a FIPS 140-2 authentication key to an ONTAP FIPS drive

[.lead]
You can use the `storage encryption disk modify` command with the `-fips-key-id` option to assign a FIPS 140-2 authentication key to a FIPS drive. Cluster nodes use this key for drive operations other than data access, such as preventing denial-of-service attacks on the drive.

.About this task

Your security setup may require you to use different keys for data authentication and FIPS 140-2 authentication. If that is not the case, you can use the same authentication key for FIPS compliance that you use for data access.

This procedure is not disruptive.

.Before you begin

The drive firmware must support FIPS 140-2 compliance. The link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] contains information about supported drive firmware versions.

.Steps
. You must first ensure you have assigned a data authentication key. This can be done with using an xref:assign-authentication-keys-seds-external-task.html[external key manager] or an xref:assign-authentication-keys-seds-onboard-task.html[onboard key manager]. Verify the key is assigned with the command `storage encryption disk show`.
. Assign a FIPS 140-2 authentication key to SEDs:
+
`storage encryption disk modify -disk _disk_id_ -fips-key-id _fips_authentication_key_id_`
+
You can use the `security key-manager query` command to view key IDs.
