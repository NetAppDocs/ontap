You can use the `storage encryption disk modify` command to assign a data authentication key to a FIPS drive or SED. Cluster nodes use this key to lock or unlock encrypted data on the drive.

.About this task

A self-encrypting drive is protected from unauthorized access only if its authentication key ID is set to a non-default value. The manufacturer secure ID (MSID), which has key ID 0x0, is the standard default value for SAS drives. For NVMe drives, the standard default value is a null key, represented as a blank key ID. When you assign the key ID to a self-encrypting drive, the system changes its authentication key ID to a non-default value.

This procedure is not disruptive. 

.Before you begin

You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.

.Steps

. Assign a data authentication key to a FIPS drive or SED:
+
`storage encryption disk modify -disk _disk_ID_ -data-key-id _key_ID_`
+

[NOTE]
====
You can use the `security key-manager query -key-type NSE-AK` command to view key IDs.
