If need to restore an onboard key management encryption key, you first verify that a key needs to be restored, then you can set up the Onboard Key Manager to restore the key.

.About this task
The procedure to restore encryption keys depends on your configuration. Follow the appropriate workflow:

* <<nine-six>>
* <<nine-five>>
* <<root_volume_encrypted>>

.Before you begin

* If you are using NSE with an external key management (KMIP) server, you must have deleted the external key manager database. For more information, see link:delete-key-management-database-task.html[transition to onboard key management from external key management]

* You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.

== Steps for ONTAP 9.6 and later [[nine-six]]

. Verify that the key needs to be restored: +
`security key-manager key query -node _node_`

. If you are running ONTAP 9.8 and later, and your root volume is encrypted, complete <<root_volume_encrypted>>.
+
If you are running ONTAP 9.6 or 9.7, or if you are running ONTAP 9.8 or later and your root volume is not encrypted, skip this step.

. Restore the key: +
`security key-manager onboard sync`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man pages.
+
The following ONTAP 9.6 command synchronize the keys in the onboard key hierarchy:
+
----
cluster1::> security key-manager onboard sync

Enter the cluster-wide passphrase for onboard key management in Vserver "cluster1"::    <32..256 ASCII characters long text>
----

. At the passphrase prompt, enter the onboard key management passphrase for the cluster.

== Steps for ONTAP 9.5 and earlier [[nine_five]]

. Verify that the key needs to be restored: +
`security key-manager key show`

. If you are running ONTAP 9.8 and later, and your root volume is encrypted, complete these steps:
+
If you are running ONTAP 9.6 or 9.7, or if you are running ONTAP 9.8 or later and your root volume is not encrypted, skip this step.

. Restore the key: +
`security key-manager setup -node _node_`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man pages.

. At the passphrase prompt, enter the onboard key management passphrase for the cluster.

== Steps for ONTAP 9.8 and later if the root volume is encrypted [[root_volume_encrypted]]

If you are running ONTAP 9.8 and later, and your root volume is encrypted, you must set an onboard key management recovery passphrase with the boot menu. This process is also necessary if you do a boot media replacement. 

. Boot the node to the boot menu and select option `(10) Set onboard key management recovery secrets`.
. Enter `y` to use this option.
. At the prompt, enter the onboard key management passphrase for the cluster.
. At the prompt, enter the backup key data.
+
The node returns to the boot menu.

. From the boot menu, select option `(1) Normal Boot`.
