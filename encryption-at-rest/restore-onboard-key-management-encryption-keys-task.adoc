[.lead]
The procedure you follow to restore your onboard key management encryption keys varies based on your version of ONTAP.

.Before you begin

* If you are using NSE with an external key management (KMIP) server, you must have deleted the external key manager database. For more information, see link:delete-key-management-database-task.html[transition to onboard key management from external key management]

* You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.

== ONTAP 9.6 and later 

[IMPORTANT]
If you are running ONTAP 9.8 or later and your root volume is encrypted, follow the procedure for <<ontap-9-8>>.

. Verify that the key needs to be restored: +
`security key-manager key query -node _node_`
+
Learn more about `security key-manager key query` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/security-key-manager-key-query.html[ONTAP command reference^].

. Restore the key: +
`security key-manager onboard sync`
+
The following ONTAP 9.6 command synchronize the keys in the onboard key hierarchy:
+
----
cluster1::> security key-manager onboard sync

Enter the cluster-wide passphrase for onboard key management in Vserver "cluster1"::    <32..256 ASCII characters long text>
----
+
Learn more about `security key-manager onboard sync` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/security-key-manager-onboard-sync.html[ONTAP command reference^].

. At the passphrase prompt, enter the onboard key management passphrase for the cluster.

[[ontap-9-8]]
== ONTAP 9.8 or later with encrypted root volume

If you are running ONTAP 9.8 and later, and your root volume is encrypted, you must set an onboard key management recovery passphrase with the boot menu. This process is also necessary if you do a boot media replacement. 

. Boot the node to the boot menu and select option `(10) Set onboard key management recovery secrets`.
. Enter `y` to use this option.
. At the prompt, enter the onboard key management passphrase for the cluster.
. At the prompt, enter the backup key data.
+
The node returns to the boot menu.

. From the boot menu, select option `(1) Normal Boot`.

== ONTAP 9.5 and earlier 

. Verify that the key needs to be restored: +
`security key-manager key show`

. If you are running ONTAP 9.8 and later, and your root volume is encrypted, complete these steps:
+
If you are running ONTAP 9.6 or 9.7, or if you are running ONTAP 9.8 or later and your root volume is not encrypted, skip this step.

. Restore the key: +
`security key-manager setup -node _node_`
+
Learn more about `security key-manager setup` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/security-key-manager-setup.html[ONTAP command reference^].

. At the passphrase prompt, enter the onboard key management passphrase for the cluster.
