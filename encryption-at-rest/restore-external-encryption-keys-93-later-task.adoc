[.lead]
You can manually restore external key management encryption keys and push them to a different node. You might want to do this if you are restarting a node that was down temporarily when you created the keys for the cluster.

.About this task

In ONTAP 9.6 and later, you can use the `security key-manager key query -node node_name` command to verify if your key needs to be restored.

In ONTAP 9.5 and earlier, you can use the `security key-manager key show` command to verify if your key needs to be restored.

Learn more about `security key-manager key query` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/security-key-manager-key-query.html[ONTAP command reference^].

.Before you begin

You must be a cluster or SVM administrator to perform this task.

.Steps

. If you are running ONTAP 9.8 or later and your root volume is encrypted, do the following:
+
If you are running ONTAP 9.7 or earlier, or if you are running ONTAP 9.8 or later and your root volume is not encrypted, skip this step.

 .. Set the bootargs:
 +
`setenv kmip.init.ipaddr <ip-address>`
 +
`setenv kmip.init.netmask <netmask>`
 +
`setenv kmip.init.gateway <gateway>`
 +
`setenv kmip.init.interface e0M`
 +
`boot_ontap`

  .. Boot the node to the boot menu and select option `(11) Configure node for external key management`.
 .. Follow prompts to enter management certificate.
+
After all management certificate information is entered, the system returns to the boot menu.

 .. From the boot menu, select option `(1) Normal Boot`.

. Restore the key:
