[.lead]
To get started with ONTAP, you need to setup your cluster, configure your network, enable service processor (SP) automatic network configuration, create a local tier, configure your protocols, and provision your storage.

[role="quick-margin-para"]

NetApp recommends that you use System Manager to link:/setup-cluster.html[set up new ONTAP clusters]. System Manager provides a simple and easy workflow for cluster set up including assigning a node management IP address and initializing the cluster.

[role="quick-margin-para"]

Configure your network by creating link:../networking/create_a_broadcast_domain97.html[broadcast domains], link:../networking/create_a_subnet.html[subnets], and optionally,  link:../networking/create_ipspaces.html[IP spaces].

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-3.png[Three] Enable SP automatic network configuration
[role="quick-margin-para"]

When you link:/system-admin/enable-sp-bmc-automatic-network-config-task.html[enable SP automatic network configuration], you do not need to manually assign IP addresses for the SP of each node. By default, the SP automatic network configuration is disabled; this is because enabling the configuration requires that the subnet to be used for the configuration be defined in the cluster first.

[role="quick-margin-para"]

link:/disks-aggregates/create-aggregates-auto-provision-task.html[Create local tiers] from the available disks or SSDs in your nodes. System Manager automatically calculates the best tier configuration based on your hardware.

[role="quick-margin-para"]

link:software_setup/configure-protocols.html[Enable NAS, SAN, or NVMe protocols] on your cluster.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-6.png[Six] Provision your storage
[role="quick-margin-para"]

Provision storage for link:../nfs-config/index.html[NFS], link:../smb-config/index.html[SMB], or link:../san-admin/index.html[SAN] configurations
