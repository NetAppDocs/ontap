To get started with ONTAP, you need to set up your cluster, configure your network, enable BMC automatic network configuration, create a local tier, configure your protocols, and provision your storage.

[role="quick-margin-para"]

NetApp recommends that you use System Manager to link:software_setup/setup-cluster.html[set up new ONTAP clusters]. System Manager provides a simple and easy workflow for cluster setup including assigning a node management IP address and initializing the cluster.

[role="quick-margin-para"]

Configure your network by creating link:networking/add_broadcast_domain.html[broadcast domains], link:networking/create_a_subnet.html[subnets], and optionally,  link:networking/create_ipspaces.html[IP spaces].

[role="quick-margin-para"]

link:disks-aggregates/create-aggregates-auto-provision-task.html[Create local tiers] from the available disks or SSDs in your nodes. System Manager automatically calculates the best tier configuration based on your hardware.
