Enable ONTAP to look up host, user, group, or netgroup information using LDAP or NIS to authenticate NAS clients.

This procedure creates or modifies LDAP or NIS configurations on an existing storage VM enabled for link:task_nas_enable_linux_nfs.html[NFS] or link:task_nas_enable_windows_smb.html[SMB].

For LDAP configurations, you should have the LDAP configuration details required in your environment and you should be using a default ONTAP LDAP schema.
