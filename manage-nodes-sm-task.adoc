Using System Manager, you can add nodes to a cluster and rename them.  You can also reboot, take over, and give back nodes.  

== Add nodes to a cluster

You can increase the size and capabilities of your cluster by adding new nodes.

.Before you Start

You should have already cabled the new nodes to the cluster.

.About this task

There are separate processes for working with System Manager in ONTAP 9.7 or ONTAP 9.8 and later.

== Shut down, reboot or edit service processor

When you reboot or shutdown a node, its HA partner automatically executes a takeover.

.Steps

. Select *Cluster > Overview*.
. Under *Nodes*, select image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon].
. Select the node and then select *Shut down*, *Reboot*, or *Edit Service Processor*.
+
If a node has been rebooted and is waiting for giveback, the *Giveback* option is also available.
+
If you select *Edit Service Processor*, you can choose *Manual* to input the IP address, subnet mask and gateway, or you can choose *DHCP* for dynamic host configuration.

== Rename nodes

Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can rename a node from the cluster overview page.

.Steps

. Select *Cluster*.  The cluster overview page displays.

. Scroll down to the *Nodes* section.

. Next to the node that you want to rename, select image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon], and select *Rename*.

. Modify the node name, and then select *Rename*.
