Using System Manager, you can add nodes to a cluster and rename them.  You can also reboot, take over, and give back nodes.  

== Add nodes to a cluster

You can increase the size and capabilities of your cluster by adding new nodes.

.Before you Start

You should have already cabled the new nodes to the cluster.

.About this task

There are separate processes for working with System Manager in ONTAP 9.7 or ONTAP 9.8 and later.

[role="tabbed-block"]
====

.ONTAP 9.8 and later procedure
--

[[add-nodes-cluster-98]]
*Adding nodes to a cluster with System Manager (ONTAP 9.8 and later)*

.Steps

. Select *Cluster > Overview*.
+
The new controllers are shown as nodes connected to the cluster network but are not in the cluster.

. Select *Add*.
+
** The nodes are added into the cluster.

** Storage is allocated implicitly.

--

.ONTAP 9.7 procedure
--

[[add-nodes-cluster-97]]
*Adding nodes to a cluster with System Manager (ONTAP 9.7)*

.Steps

.	Select *(Return to classic version)*.

.	Select *Configurations > Cluster Expansion*.
+
System Manager automatically discovers the new nodes.

.	Select *Switch to the new experience*.

.	Select *Cluster > Overview* to view the new nodes.

== Shut down, reboot or edit service processor

When you reboot or shutdown a node, its HA partner automatically executes a takeover.

[NOTE]
This procedure applies to FAS, AFF, and current ASA systems. If you have an ASA r2 system (ASA A1K, ASA A90, ASA A70, ASA A50, ASA A30, or ASA A20), follow link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/asa-r2/administer/reboot-take-over-give-back-nodes.html[these steps^] to shutdown and reboot a node. ASA r2 systems provide a simplified ONTAP experience specific to SAN-only customers.

.Steps

. Select *Cluster > Overview*.
. Under *Nodes*, select image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon].
. Select the node and then select *Shut down*, *Reboot*, or *Edit Service Processor*.
+
If a node has been rebooted and is waiting for giveback, the *Giveback* option is also available.
+
If you select *Edit Service Processor*, you can choose *Manual* to input the IP address, subnet mask and gateway, or you can choose *DHCP* for dynamic host configuration.

== Rename nodes

Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can rename a node from the cluster overview page.

[NOTE]
This procedure applies to FAS, AFF, and current ASA systems. If you have an ASA r2 system (ASA A1K, ASA A90, ASA A70, ASA A50, ASA A30, or ASA A20), follow link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/asa-r2/administer/rename-nodes.html[these steps^] to rename a node. ASA r2 systems provide a simplified ONTAP experience specific to SAN-only customers.

.Steps

. Select *Cluster*.  The cluster overview page displays.

. Scroll down to the *Nodes* section.

. Next to the node that you want to rename, select image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon], and select *Rename*.

. Modify the node name, and then select *Rename*.
