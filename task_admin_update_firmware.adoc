[[update-firmware-automatically]]
== Update firmware automatically

Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can enable the Automatic Update feature of System Manager to allow ONTAP to automatically download and install recommended software patches, upgrades, and updates provided by NetApp (the default behavior).

.Before you begin

The Automatic Update feature requires AutoSupport connectivity over HTTPS.  To troubleshoot connectivity problems, see link:../system-admin/troubleshoot-autosupport-http-https-task.html[Troubleshoot AutoSupport message delivery over HTTP or HTTPS].

.About this task

Updates include firmware patches, upgrades, and updates for the following categories:

*	*Storage firmware*:  Storage devices, disks, and disk shelves
*	*SP/BMC firmware*:  Service processors and SP/BMC modules

In System Manager, you can change the default behavior per category so that you receive recommendations from Active IQ Digital Advisor for fixes and updates to firmware, allowing you to decide which ones to install and to set the schedule when you want them to install.  You can also turn off the feature.

To schedule fixes and updates to occur automatically and to receive recommendations about updating, you perform the following workflow tasks:
