You can use the non-volatile memory express (NVMe) protocol to provide storage in a SAN environment.  The NVMe protocol is optimized for performance with solid state storage.

For NVMe, storage targets are called namespaces.  An NVMe namespace is a quantity of non-volatile storage that can be formatted into logical blocks and presented to a host as a standard block device.  You create namespaces and subsystems, and then map the namespaces to the subsystems, similar to the way LUNs are provisioned and mapped to igroups for FC and iSCSI.

NVMe targets are connected to the network through a standard FC infrastructure using FC switches or a standard TCP infrastructure using Ethernet switches and host-side adapters.

The following NVMe protocols are supported:

[cols=3*, options="header"]
|===
| Protocol
| Starting with...
| Allowed by...

| TCP
| ONTAP 9.10.1
| Default

| FCP
