Beginning with ONTAP 9.17.1, ARP requires an evaluation period to determine if entropy levels for SAN volume workloads are suitable for ransomware protection. After ARP is enabled on a SAN volume, it monitors data continuously during an evaluation period to determine an optimal encryption threshold. ARP distinguishes between suitable and unsuitable workloads in the evaluated SAN volume and, if the workloads are determined to be suitable for protection, automatically sets an encryption threshold based on evaluation period statistics. 

== Understand entropy evaluation

The system collects continuous encryption statistics in 10-minute intervals. During the evaluation, ARP periodic snapshots are also continuously created every four hours. If the encryption percentage within an interval exceeds the optimal encryption threshold identified for this volume, an alert is triggered, an `Anti_ransomware_attack_backup` snapshot is created, and snapshot retention time is increased on any periodic ARP snapshots.

.Confirm that the evaluation period is active
You can confirm that the evaluation is active by running the following command and confirming a status of `evaluation_period`. The evaluation period applies to volumes containing either LUNs or VMDKs. If a volume does not contain a LUN or VMDK, the evaluation status will not be displayed.

.Monitor evaluation period data collection

You can monitor encryption detection in real time by running the following command. The command returns a histogram showing the amount of data in each encryption percentage range. The histogram is updated every 10 minutes.

== Suitable workloads and adaptive thresholds

The evaluation ends with one of the following results:

* *The workload is suitable for ARP*. ARP automatically sets the adaptive threshold to higher than 10% of the maximum encryption percentage seen during the evaluation period. ARP also continues statistics collection and creates periodic ARP snapshots.
* *The workload is unsuitable for ARP*. ARP automatically sets the adaptive threshold to the maximum encryption percentage seen during the evaluation period. ARP also continues statistics collection and creates periodic ARP snapshots, but the system ultimately recommends disabling ARP on the volume.

.Determine evaluation results
After the evaluation period ends, ARP automatically sets the adaptive threshold based on the evaluation results.

You can determine the evaluation results by running the following command. Volume suitability is indicated in the `Block device detection status` field:
