= Restore data from ONTAP ARP snapshots after a ransomware attack

[.lead]
Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP) creates snapshots named `Anti_ransomware_backup` when it detects a potential ransomware threat. You can use one of these ARP snapshots or another snapshot of your volume to restore data. 

.About this task
If the volume has SnapMirror relationships, manually replicate all mirror copies of the volume immediately after you restore from a snapshot. Not doing so can result in unusable mirror copies that must be deleted and recreated.

To restore from a snapshot other than the `Anti_ransomware_backup` snapshot after a system attack was identified, you must first release the ARP snapshot.

If no system attack was reported, you must first restore from the `Anti_ransomware_backup` snapshot then complete a subsequent restoration of the volume from the snapshot of your choosing. 

.Steps

You can use System Manager or the ONTAP CLI to restore your data.

.Restore after a system attack
. To restore from the ARP snapshot, skip to step two. To restore from an earlier snapshot, you must first release the lock on the ARP snapshot.
.. Select *Storage > Volumes*.
.. Select *Security* then *View Suspected File Types*.
.. Mark the files as "Potential ransomware attack".
.. Select *Update* and *Clear Suspect File Types*.
. Display the snapshots in volumes:
+
Select *Storage > Volumes*, then select the volume and *Snapshot Copies*.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon] next to the snapshot you want to restore then *Restore*.

.Restore if a system attack was not identified 
. Display the snapshots in volumes:
+
Select *Storage > Volumes*, then select the volume and *Snapshot Copies*.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon] them choose the `Anti_ransomware_backup` snapshot. 
. Select *Restore*.
. Return to the *Snapshot Copies* menu, then choose the snapshot you want to use. Select *Restore*.

.Restore after a system attack
. To restore from the ARP snapshot, skip to step two. To restore data from earlier snapshots, you must release the lock on the ARP snapshot.
+
NOTE: It is only necessary to release the anti-ransomware Snaplock before restoring from earlier snapshots if you are using the `volume snap restore` command as outlined below. If you are restoring data using FlexClone, Single File Snap Restore, or other methods, this is not necessary.
+
Mark the attack as a potential ransomware attack (`-false-positive false`) and clear suspect files (`clear-suspect`):
`anti-ransomware volume attack clear-suspect -vserver _svm_name_ -volume _vol_name_ [_extension identifiers_] -false-positive false`
Use one of the following parameters to identify the extensions:
`[-seq-no _integer_]` Sequence number of the file in the suspect list.
`[-extension _text_, … ]` File extensions
`[-start-time _date_time_ -end-time _date_time_]` Starting and ending times for the range of files to be cleared, in the form "MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS".
