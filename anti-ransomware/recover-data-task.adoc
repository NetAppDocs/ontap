[.lead]
Snapshot copies named “Anti_ransomware_backup” are created when Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP) detects a potential attack. You can restore data from these ARP copies or from other Snapshot copies.

.About this task
If the volume has SnapMirror relationships, manually replicate all mirror copies of the volume immediately after you restore from a Snapshot copy. Not doing so can result in unusable mirror copies that must be deleted and recreated.

.Steps

You can use System Manager or the ONTAP CLI to restore your data.

. If you want to restore data from earlier Snapshot copies instead of from the ARP copies, you must release the anti-ransomware Snapshot lock. If you want to restore from the ARP copies, it is not necessary to release the lock and you can skip this step.

.. Select *Storage > Volumes*.
.. Select *Security* then *View Suspected File Types*
.. Mark the files as "False Positive" .
.. Select *Update* and *Clear Suspect File Types*

a| To release the Snapshot lock, you must restore from the ARP copies before you restore from earlier Snapshot copies.

Follow steps 2-3 to restore data from the ARP copies, then repeat the process to restore from earlier Snapshot copies.

Select *Storage > Volumes*, then select the volume and *Snapshot Copies*.

. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu Option] next to the Snapshot copy you want to restore then *Restore*.

. If you want to restore data from earlier Snapshot copies, instead of from the ARP copies, you must do the following to release the anti-ransomware Snapshot lock.  If you want to restore from the ARP copies, it is not necessary to release the lock and you can skip this step.
+
NOTE: It is only necessary to release the anti-ransomware Snaplock before restoring from earlier Snapshot copies if you are using the `volume snap restore` command as outlined below.  If you are restoring data using Flex Clone, Single File Snap Restore or other methods, this is not necessary.

Mark the attack as a "false positive" and "clear suspect".

`anti-ransomware volume attack clear-suspect -vserver _svm_name_ -volume _vol_name_ [_extension identifiers_] -false-positive true`

Use one of the following parameters to identify the extensions:
`[-seq-no _integer_]` Sequence number of the file in the suspect list.
`[-extension _text_, … ]` File extensions
`[-start-time _date_time_ -end-time _date_time_]` Starting and ending times for the range of files to be cleared, in the form "MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS".

a| To release the Snapshot lock, you must restore from the ARP copies before you restore from earlier Snapshot copies.

Follow steps 2-3 to restore data from the ARP copies, then repeat the process to restore from earlier Snapshot copies.
