Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, you can modify the parameters for ransomware detection on a specific volume with Autonomous Ransomware Protection enabled and report a known surge as normal file activity. Adjusting detection parameters helps improve the accuracy of reporting based on your specific volume workload.

== How attack detection works

When Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP) is in a learning or evalution mode, it develops baseline values for volume behaviors. These include entropy, file extensions, and, beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, IOPS. These baselines are used to evaluate ransomware threats. For more information about these criteria, see xref:index.html#what-arp-detects[what ARP detects].

Certain volumes and workloads require different detection parameters. For example, your ARP-enabled volume may host numerous types of file extensions, in which case you may want to modify the threshold count for never-before-seen file extensions to a number greater than the default of 20 or disable warnings based on never-before-seen file extensions. Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, you can modify the attack detection parameters so they better fit your specific workloads.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can configure alerts when ARP observes a new file extension and when ARP creates a snapshot. For more information, see <<modify-alerts>>.

.Attack detection in NAS environments
In ONTAP 9.10.1, ARP issues a warning if it detects both of the following conditions:

* More than 20 files with file extensions not previously observed in the volume
* High entropy data

Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, ARP issues a threat warning if _only_ one condition is met. For example, if more than 20 files with file extensions that have not previously been observed in the volume are observed within a 24-hour period, ARP will categorize this as a threat _regardless_ of observed entropy. The 24-hour and 20-file values are defaults, which can be modified.

NOTE: To reduce high numbers of false positive alerts, go to *Storage > Volumes > Security > Configure workload characteristics* and disable *Monitor new file types*. This setting is disabled by default in ONTAP 9.14.1 P7, 9.15.1 P1, 9.16.1, and later.

.Attack detection in SAN environments
Beginning with ONTAP 9.17.1, ARP issues a warning if it detects high encryption rates that exceed an automatically learned threshold. This threshold is established after an link:respond-san-entropy-eval-period.html[evaluation period] but can be modified.

== Modify attack detection parameters

Depending on the expected behaviors of your ARP-enabled volume, you may want to modify the attack detection parameters.

== Report known surges

ARP continues to modify baseline values for detection parameters even when active. If you know of surges in your volume activity, either one-time surges or a surge that is characteristic of a new normal, you should report them as safe. Manually reporting these surges as safe helps to improve the accuracy of ARP's threat assessments. 

.Report a one-time surge
. If a one-time surge is occurring under known circumstances and you want ARP to report a similar surge in future circumstances, clear the surge from the workload behavior:  
+
`security anti-ransomware volume workload-behavior clear-surge -vserver <svm_name> -volume <volume_name>`
+
Learn more about `security anti-ransomware volume workload-behavior clear-surge` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/security-anti-ransomware-volume-workload-behavior-clear-surge.html[ONTAP command reference^].

.Modify baseline surge 
. If a reported surge should be considered normal application behavior, report the surge as such to modify the baseline surge value.
+
`security anti-ransomware volume workload-behavior update-baseline-from-surge -vserver <svm_name> -volume <volume_name>`

== Configure ARP alerts  

Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, ARP allows you to specify alerts for two ARP events:

* Observation of new file extension on a volume
* Creation of an ARP snapshot 

Alerts for these two events can be set on individual volumes or for the entire SVM. If you enable alerts for the SVM, the alert settings are inherited only by volumes created after you enable alert. By default, alerts are not enabled on any volume. 

Event alerts can be controlled with multi-admin verification. For more information, see xref:use-cases-restrictions-concept.html#multi-admin-verification-with-volumes-protected-with-arp[Multi-admin verification with volumes protected with ARP].

.Steps
You can use System Manager or the ONTAP CLI to set alerts for ARP events.
