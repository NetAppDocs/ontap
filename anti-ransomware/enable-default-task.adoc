Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can configure storage VMs (SVMs) such that new volumes are enabled by default for Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP) in learning mode.

.What you'll need

*	The correct license is installed for your ONTAP version.
+
[cols="2*",options="header"]
|===
| ONTAP releases| License
a| ONTAP 9.11.1 and later
a| Anti_ransomware
a| ONTAP 9.8-9.10.1
a| MT_EK_MGMT (Multi-Tenant Key Management)
|===

* Optional but recommended: Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, you can enable multi-admin verification (MAV) so that two or more authenticated user admins are required for anti-ransomware operations. link:../multi-admin-verify/enable-disable-task.html[Learn more^].

.About this task
New volumes are created by default with ARP in disabled mode, but you can change this setting in System Manager and at the CLI. Volumes enabled by default are set to ARP in learning mode. Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, adaptive learning has been added to ARP analytics so that the switch from learning mode to active mode is done automatically.

[NOTE]
====
Enabling ARP by default for new volumes in an SVM does not automatically enable ARP for existing volumes in that SVM. Learn how to link:enable-task.html[enable ARP in an existing volume].

.Steps

[role="tabbed-block"]
====
.System Manager
--
.	Click *Storage > Storage VMs* and then select the storage VM for default anti-virus.
.	In the *Settings* tab, [in the *Security* section], click image:icon_pencil.gif["pen icon"] in the *Anti-ransomware* box, then check the box to enable ARP for NAS volumes.
.	Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, you can also choose *Switch automatically from learning to active mode after sufficient learning* to allow ARP to determine the optimal learning period interval and automate the switch. 
--

.CLI
--
.	Modify an existing SVM to enable ARP by default in new volumes:
`vserver modify -vserver _svm_name_ -anti-ransomware-default-volume-state dry-run`
+
At the CLI, you can also create a new SVM with ARP enabled by default for new volumes.
`vserver create -vserver svm_name -anti-ransomware-default-volume-state dry-run [_other parameters as needed_]`
+
Optionally, for ONTAP 9.13.1 or later, you can enable adaptive learning so that the ARP change from learning to active state in new volumes is done automatically:
+
`vserver modify _svm_name_ -anti-ransomware-auto-switch-from-learning-to-enabled true`
