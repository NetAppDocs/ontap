Beginning with ONTAP 9.16.1, ARP has adopted Autonomous Ransomware Protection with Artificial Intelligence (ARP/AI) to improve threat detection and response. After you upgrade your cluster to ONTAP 9.16.1 for NAS or ONTAP 9.17.1 for SAN, ARP/AI will be automatically enabled for FlexVol volumes if ARP is already enabled for those volumes. If you have not enabled ARP or have not enabled ONTAP link:../update/enable-automatic-updates-task.html[automatic updates] for your cluster, you should follow one of the scenarios described in this procedure.

IMPORTANT: Before upgrading to an ONTAP version with ARP/AI support, link:../upgrade/arp-warning-clear.html[close out any existing ARP detections].

.Before you begin

* You must have FlexVol volumes to use ARP/AI. If you have FlexGroup volumes, the ARP model used prior to ARP/AI continues to operate after upgrading to ONTAP 9.16.1 or later.

NOTE: (NAS environments only) When you upgrade to ONTAP 9.16.1 or later, ARP is enabled and becomes active automatically for any existing ARP instances with FlexVol volumes. Because ARP/AI is trained on an extensive machine learning model, a learning period is no longer required. Any learning periods that have not been completed prior to upgrade will automatically be ended, and the volumes transitioned to active ARP/AI.

.Steps

. Follow the scenario that is specific to your configuration:

* *NAS environments only*

** *For new clusters running ONTAP 9.16.1 or later with FlexVol volumes*: link:enable-task.html[Enable ARP]. ARP is not enabled by default. After you enable ARP, ARP/AI functionality is automatically enabled on the FlexVol volumes you choose to protect. 
** *For existing clusters recently upgraded to ONTAP 9.16.1 and later that have ARP enabled*: No action is needed. ARP/AI automatically becomes the new ARP method of threat protection on the FlexVol volumes you've chosen to protect. 
** *For existing clusters recently upgraded to ONTAP 9.16.1 and later that do not have ARP enabled*: link:enable-task.html[Enable ARP]. ARP/AI automatically becomes the new ARP method of threat protection after you enable ARP.

* *SAN environments only* 

** *For new and existing clusters running ONTAP 9.17.1 or later with FlexVol volumes*: When you upgrade to or install ONTAP 9.17.1 or later, you should link:enable-task.html[enable ARP] on volumes you intend to protect. When you enable ARP using System Manager or the CLI, ARP/AI functionality is automatically enabled. Once enabled on a SAN volume, link:respond-san-entropy-eval-period.html[ARP/AI monitors data continuously during an evaluation period] to determine if the workloads are suitable for ARP and set an optimal encryption threshold for detection.

. After ARP/AI is enabled, decide whether you want ARP/AI protection updates to be delivered and installed link:arp-ai-automatic-updates.html[automatically or manually].
