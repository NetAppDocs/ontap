Beginning with ONTAP 9.16.1, ARP has adopted Autonomous Ransomware Protection with Artificial Intelligence (ARP/AI) to improve threat detection and response. After you upgrade your cluster to ONTAP 9.16.1, ARP/AI will be automatically enabled for FlexVol volumes if ARP is already enabled for those volumes. If you have not enabled ARP or have not enabled automatic updates for your cluster, you should follow one of the scenarios described in this procedure.

IMPORTANT: Before upgrading to ONTAP 9.16.1, link:../upgrade/arp-warning-clear.html[close out any existing ARP detections].

.Before you begin

* You must have FlexVol volumes to use ARP/AI. If you have FlexGroup volumes, the ARP model used prior to ARP/AI continues to operate after upgrading to ONTAP 9.16.1.

NOTE: When you upgrade to ONTAP 9.16.1, ARP is enabled and becomes active automatically for any existing ARP instances with FlexVol volumes. Because ARP/AI is trained on an extensive machine learning model, a learning period is no longer required. Any learning periods that have not been completed prior to upgrade will automatically be ended and the volumes transitioned to active ARP/AI.

.Steps

. Follow the scenario that is specific to your configuration:

* *For new clusters running ONTAP 9.16.1*: link:enable-task.html[Enable ARP]. ARP is not enabled by default. After you enable ARP, ARP/AI functionality is automatically enabled and active on the volumes you choose to protect. 
* *For existing clusters recently upgraded to ONTAP 9.16.1 that have ARP enabled*: No action needed. ARP/AI will automatically become the new ARP method of threat protection on the FlexVol volumes you've chosen to protect. 
* *For existing clusters recently upgraded to ONTAP 9.16.1 that do not have ARP enabled*: link:enable-task.html[Enable ARP]. ARP/AI will automatically become the new ARP method of threat protection after you enable ARP.

. After ARP/AI is enabled, decide whether you want ARP/AI protection updates to be delivered and installed link:arp-ai-automatic-updates.html[automatically or manually] installed.
