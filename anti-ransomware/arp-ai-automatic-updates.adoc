[.lead]
To keep protection up to date against the latest ransomware threats, ARP/AI offers automatic updates that occur outside of regular ONTAP release cadences.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.16.1, security updates for ARP/AI are available in System Manager software downloads in addition to system and firmware updates. If your ONTAP cluster is already enrolled in link:../update/enable-automatic-updates-task.html[automatic system and firmware updates], you will be automatically notified when ARP/AI security updates are available. You can also change <<Select an update preference for ARP/AI,your update preferences>> so that ONTAP installs security updates automatically.

If you want to <<Manually update ARP/AI with the latest security package,manually update ARP/AI>>, you can download updates from the NetApp Support Site and install them using System Manager.

In System Manager, the settings on the Enable automatic updates page for security files are set to `Show notifications` if you are already enrolled in automatic firmware and system updates. You can change the update settings to `Automatically update` if you'd prefer ONTAP to apply the latest updates automatically. If you use a dark site or prefer to perform updates manually, you can choose to show notifications or automatically dismiss security updates.
