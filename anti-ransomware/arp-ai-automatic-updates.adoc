[.lead]
To keep protection up to date against the latest ransomware threats, ARP/AI offers automatic updates that occur outside of regular ONTAP release cadences.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.16.1, security updates for ARP/AI are available in System Manager software downloads in addition to system and firmware updates. If your ONTAP cluster is already enrolled in link:../update/enable-automatic-updates-task.html[automatic system and firmware updates], you will be automatically notified when ARP/AI security updates are available. You can also change <<Select an update preference for ARP/AI,update preferences>> so that ONTAP installs security updates automatically.

If you want to <<Manually update ARP/AI with the latest security package,manually update ARP/AI>>, you can download updates from the NetApp Support Site and install them using System Manager.

.About this task

For ONTAP 9.16.1 and later, you can only update ARP/AI using System Manager. 

== Select an update preference for ARP/AI

In System Manager, the settings on the Enable automatic updates page for security files are set to `Show notifications` if you are already enrolled in automatic firmware and system updates. You can change the update setting to `Automatically update` if you'd prefer ONTAP to apply the latest updates automatically. If you use a dark site or prefer to perform updates manually, you can choose to show notifications or automatically dismiss security updates.
