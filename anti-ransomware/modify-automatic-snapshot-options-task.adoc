= Adjust settings for automatically generated ARP snapshots

[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, you can use the CLI to control the retention settings for Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP) snapshots that are automatically generated in response to suspected ransomware attacks. 

.Before you begin 
You can only modify ARP snapshots options on a node SVM and not on other link:../system-admin/types-svms-concept.html[SVM types]. 

Learn more about the commands described in this procedure in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/[ONTAP command reference^].

.Steps

. Show all current ARP snapshot settings:
+
[source,cli]
----
options -option-name arw*
----

. Show selected current ARP snapshot settings:
+
[source,cli]
----
options -option-name <arw_setting_name>
----

. Modify ARP snapshot settings:
+
[source,cli]
----
options -option-name <arw_setting_name> -option-value <arw_setting_value>
----
+
The following settings are modifiable:
+
NOTE: Some of the commands described are deprecated as of ONTAP 9.17.1. Commands introduced in ONTAP 9.17.1 support both NAS and SAN environments.

|===
| Setting | Description | Supported versions
| `arw.snap.max.count` 
a| Specifies the maximum number of ARP snapshots that can exist in a volume at any given time. Older copies are deleted to ensure that the total number of ARP snapshots are within this specified limit.
a| ONTAP 9.11.1 and later
| `arw.snap.create.interval.hours` 
a| Specifies the interval _in hours_ between ARP snapshots. A new ARP snapshot is created when an data entropy-based attack is suspected and the most recently created ARP snapshot is older than the specified interval.
a| ONTAP 9.11.1 and later
| `arw.snap.normal.retain.interval.hours` 
a| Specifies the duration _in hours_ for which an ARP snapshot is retained. When an ARP snapshot reaches the retention threshold, any other ARP snapshots copy created before it is deleted.
a| ONTAP 9.11.1 to ONTAP 9.16.1
| `arw.snap.max.retain.interval.days`
a| Specifies the maximum duration _in days_ for which an ARP snapshot can be retained. Any ARP snapshot older than this duration is deleted when there is no attack reported on the volume.
[NOTE]
The maximum retention interval for ARP snapshots is ignored if a moderate threat is detected. The ARP snapshot created in response to the threat is retained until you have responded to the threat. When you mark a threat as a false positive, ONTAP will delete the ARP snapshots for the volume.
a| ONTAP 9.11.1 to ONTAP 9.16.1 
|`arw.snap.create.interval.hours.post.max.count` 
a| Specifies the interval _in hours_ between ARP snapshots when the volume already contains the maximum number of ARP snapshots. When the maximum number is reached, an ARP snapshot is deleted to make room for a new copy. The new ARP snapshot creation speed can be reduced to retain the older copy using this option. If the volume already contains the maximum number of ARP snapshots, the interval specified in this option is used for next ARP snapshot creation, instead of `arw.snap.create.interval.hours`.
a| ONTAP 9.11.1 to 9.16.1
| `arw.surge.snap.interval.days`
a| Specifies the interval _in days_ between ARP snapshots created in response to IO surges. ONTAP creates an ARP snapshot surge copy when there's a surge in IO traffic and the last created ARP snapshot is older than this specified interval. This option also specifies retention period _in day_ for an ARP surge snapshot.
a| ONTAP 9.11.1 and later
| `arw.snap.new.extns.interval.hours` 
a| This option specifies the interval _in hours_ between the ARP snapshots created when a new file extension is detected. A new ARP snapshot is created when a new file extension is observed; the previous snapshot created upon observing a new file extension is older than this specified interval. On a workload that frequently creates new file extensions, this interval helps in controlling the frequency of the ARP snapshots. This option exists independent of `arw.snap.create.interval.hours`, which specifies the interval for data entropy-based ARP snapshots.
a| ONTAP 9.11.1 to ONTAP 9.16.1
| `arw.high.encryption.alert.enabled` 
a| This option enables alerts for high levels of encryption. When this option is set to `on` (default), ONTAP creates an ARP snapshot when the percentage of encryption exceeds the threshold specified in `arw.high.encryption.percentage.threshold`.
a| ONTAP 9.17.1 and later
| `arw.high.encryption.percentage.threshold` 
a| This option specifies the maximum percentage of encryption for a volume. If the percentage of encryption is more than this threshold, ONTAP handles the increase as an attack and creates an ARP snapshot. `arw.high.encryption.alert.enabled` must be set to `on` for this option to take effect.
a| ONTAP 9.17.1 and later
| `arw.snap.high.encryption.retain.duration.hours` 
a| This option defines the retention duration for snapshots created after a high encryption threshold event.
a| ONTAP 9.17.1 and later
| `arw.medium.encryption.percentage.threshold` 
a| This option specifies the percentage of encryption for a volume. You might adjust this percentage as part of encryption analysis when determining acceptable thresholds. Medium encryption activity is not reported as an attack. If you want to report medium encryption activity as an attack, adjust the high encryption percentage threshold to match.
a| ONTAP 9.17.1 and later
| `arw.snap.medium.encryption.retain.duration.hours` 
a| This option defines the retention duration for snapshots created after a medium encryption threshold event.
a| ONTAP 9.17.1 and later
