[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, the Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP) feature uses workload analysis in NAS (NFS and SMB) environments to proactively detect and warn about abnormal activity that might indicate a ransomware attack. 

ARP is built directly into ONTAP, ensuring integrated control and coordination with ONTAP's other features. ARP operates in real-time, processing data as it's written to or read from the file system, and detecting and responding to potential ransomware attacks quickly. 

When an attack is suspected, ARP creates new snapshots in addition to the existing protection provided by scheduled snapshots.

== Licenses and enablement 

ARP support is included with the link:https://kb.netapp.com/onprem/ontap/os/ONTAP_9.10.1_and_later_licensing_overview[ONTAP ONE license^]. If you do not have the ONTAP One license, other licenses are available for ARP use that differ depending on your version of ONTAP. 

[cols="2*",options="header"]
|===
| ONTAP releases| License
a| ONTAP 9.11.1 and later a| `Anti_ransomware`
a| ONTAP 9.10.1 a| `MT_EK_MGMT` (Multi-Tenant Key Management)
|===

* If you are upgrading from ONTAP 9.10.1 to ONTAP 9.11.1 or later and ARP is already configured on your system, you do not need to install the new `Anti-ransomware` license. For new ARP configurations, the new license is required.
* If you are reverting from ONTAP 9.11.1 or later to ONTAP 9.10.1, and you have enabled ARP with the Anti_ransomware license, you will see a warning message and might need to reconfigure ARP. link:../revert/anti-ransomware-license-task.html[Learn about reverting ARP].

link:enable-task.html[You can enable Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP) on an existing volume or create a new volume and enable ARP].

== ONTAP ransomware protection strategy

An effective ransomware detection strategy should include more than a single layer of protection.

An analogy would be the safety features of a vehicle. You don't rely on a single feature, such as a seatbelt, to completely protect you in an accident. Air bags, anti-lock brakes, and forward-collision warning are all additional safety features that will lead to a much better outcome. Ransomware protection should be viewed in the same way.

While ONTAP includes features like FPolicy, snapshots, SnapLock, and Active IQ Digital Advisor (also known as Digital Advisor) to help protect from ransomware, the following information focuses on the ARP feature with machine learning capabilities.

To learn more about ONTAP's other anti-ransomware features, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-technical-reports/ransomware-solutions/ransomware-active-iq.html[Ransomware and NetApp's protection portfolio^].

== What ARP detects

ONTAP ARP is designed to protect against denial-of-service attacks where the attacker withholds data until a ransom is paid. ARP offers real-time ransomware detection based on the following: 

* Identification of the incoming data as either encrypted or plain text.
* Analytics that detect:
** *Entropy*: (Used in NAS and SAN) An evaluation of the randomness of data in a file
** *File extension types*: (Used in NAS only) A file extension that does not conform to expected extension types
** *File IOPS*: (Used in NAS only beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1) A surge in abnormal volume activity with data encryption

ARP detects the spread of most ransomware attacks after only a small number of files are encrypted, responds automatically to protect data, and alerts you that a suspected attack is happening.

[NOTE]
No ransomware detection or prevention system can completely guarantee safety from a ransomware attack. Although it's possible an attack might go undetected, ARP acts as an important additional layer of defense if anti-virus software has failed to detect an intrusion.

== Learning and active modes

ARP can be run in one of several modes depending on the complexity and evaluation needs of your environment. When necessary, ARP uses a learning or evaluation period to establish a baseline of normal workload behavior. During that period, ARP analyzes system metrics to develop an alert profile before enabling active protection. After ARP transitions to an active detection mode, it begins monitoring abnormal activity in real time, automatically taking protective actions and generating alerts if abnormal behavior is detected.

For ARP, the learning mode and active mode behaviors differ by ONTAP version, volume type, and protocol (NAS or SAN).

=== NAS environments and mode types

Learning and active modes are used for NAS environments. For <<arp-ai,ARP/AI>> running in NAS environments beginning in ONTAP 9.16.1, there is no learning period when ARP is used with FlexVol volumes.

The following table summarizes the differences between ONTAP 9.10.1 and later versions for NAS environments.

[cols="1,5,1", options="header"]
|===
| Mode | Description | Volume types and versions
| Learning 
a| For ONTAP 9.10.1 to 9.15.1, ARP is automatically set to learning mode when you enable ARP. In learning mode, the ONTAP system develops an alert profile based on the analytic areas: entropy, file extension types, and file IOPS. It's recommended that you leave ARP in learning mode for 30 days. Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, ARP automatically determines the optimal learning interval and automates the switch, which might occur before 30 days. For versions earlier than ONTAP 9.13.1, you can make the switch manually.

link:switch-learning-to-active-mode.html[Learn more about switching from learning to active mode].

TIP: The command `security anti-ransomware volume workload-behavior show` shows file extensions that have been detected in the volume. If you run this command early in learning mode and it shows an accurate representation of file types, you should not use that data as a basis to move to active mode, as ONTAP is still collecting other metrics. Learn more about `security anti-ransomware volume workload-behavior show` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/security-anti-ransomware-volume-workload-behavior-show.html[ONTAP command reference^].
a| * FlexVol volumes with ONTAP 9.10.1 to 9.15.1 
* FlexGroup volumes with ONTAP 9.16.1

| Active 
a| After running ARP in learning mode for enough time to assess workload characteristics, you can switch to active mode and start protecting your data. Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, ARP automatically determines the optimal learning interval and automates the switch, which might occur before 30 days.

With ONTAP 9.10.1 to 9.15.1, ARP switches to active mode after the optimal learning period is completed. After ARP has switched to active mode, ONTAP creates ARP snapshots to protect the data if a threat is detected.

In active mode, if a file extension is flagged as abnormal, you should evaluate the alert. You can act on the alert to protect your data or you can mark the alert as a false positive. Marking an alert as a false positive updates the alert profile. For example, if the alert is triggered by a new file extension and you mark the alert as a false positive, you will not receive an alert the next time that file extension is observed. 

a| * FlexVol volumes with ONTAP 9.10.1 to 9.15.1 
* FlexGroup volumes with ONTAP 9.16.1

=== SAN environments and mode types

Beginning with ONTAP 9.17.1, ONTAP ARP supports SAN environments. SAN environments use _evaluation_ periods (similar to learning modes in NAS environments) before transitioning to active detection automatically. The following table summarizes evaluation and active modes.

[cols="1,5,1", options="header"]
|===
| Mode | Description | Volume types and versions
| Evaluation
a| A two- to four-week evaluation period is performed to determine baseline encryption behavior. You can determine if the evaluation period is complete by running the `security anti-ransomware volume show` command and checking `Block device detection status`.

link:respond-san-entropy-eval-period.html[Learn more about SAN volumes and the entropy evaluation period].

a| * FlexVol volumes with ONTAP 9.17.1 and later

| Active
a| After the evaluation period, you can determine if the ARP SAN protection is active by running the `security anti-ransomware volume show` command and checking `Block device detection status`. A status of `Active_suitable_workload` indicates that the evaluated amount of entropy can be successfully monitored. ARP automatically adjusts the adaptive threshold according to data reviewed during the evaluation.

a| * FlexVol volumes with ONTAP 9.17.1 and later

== Threat assessment and ARP snapshots

ARP assesses threat probability based on incoming data measured against learned analytics. When ARP detects an abnormality, a measurement is assigned. A snapshot might be assigned at the time of detection or at regular intervals.

=== ARP thresholds

* *Low*: The earliest detection of an abnormality in the volume (for example, a new file extension is observed in the volume). This level of detection is only available in versions prior to ONTAP 9.16.1 that do not have ARP/AI.

** In ONTAP 9.10.1, the threshold for escalation to moderate is 100 or more files.
** Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, you can xref:manage-parameters-task.html[customize the detection parameters for ARP].

* *Moderate*: High entropy is detected or multiple files with the same never-seen-before file extension are observed. This is the baseline detection level in ONTAP 9.16.1 and later with ARP/AI.

The threat escalates to moderate after ONTAP runs an analytics report determining if the abnormality matches a ransomware profile. When the attack probability is moderate, ONTAP generates an EMS notification prompting you to assess the threat. ONTAP does not send alerts about low threats; however, beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can xref:manage-parameters-task.html#modify-alerts[modify default alert settings]. For more information, see xref:respond-abnormal-task.html[Respond to abnormal activity].

You can view information about moderate threats in System Manager's *Events* section or with the `security anti-ransomware volume show` command. Low threat events can also be viewed using the `security anti-ransomware volume show` command in versions prior to ONTAP 9.16.1 that do not have ARP/AI. Learn more about `security anti-ransomware volume show` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/security-anti-ransomware-volume-show.html[ONTAP command reference^].

=== ARP snapshots

For ONTAP 9.16.1 and earlier, when ONTAP detects an abnormality it creates a snapshot of the volume to create the best recovery point. Beginning with ONTAP 9.17.1, ARP snapshots are generated at regular intervals for both NAS and SAN volumes. ONTAP prepends a name to the ARP snapshot to make it easily identifiable. 

//For ONTAP 9.16.1 and earlier, individual ARP snapshots are retained for two days. If there are multiple ARP snapshots, they are retained for five days by default. Beginning with ONTAP 9.17.1, the retention duration of a snapshot is determined by the level of abnormal activity detected following its creation. 

Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, you can modify the retention settings. For more information, see xref:modify-automatic-shapshot-options-task.html[Modify options for snapshots].

//Similar information repeated in respond-abnormal-task.adoc

The following table summarizes ARP snapshot differences between ONTAP 9.16.1 and earlier and ONTAP 9.17.1.

a| * Determined based on trigger conditions (not fixed)
* Snapshots created before the attack are retained until administrator marks the attack as true or a false positive (clear-suspect).
a| Snapshots are normally retained for 12 hours. 

If an attack is detected:

* (NAS) Snapshots created before the attack are retained until administrator marks the attack as true or a false positive (clear-suspect).
* (SAN) Entropy-triggered snapshots have extended retention (10 days, configurable).

| Clear-suspect action
a| Administrators can perform a clear-suspect action which sets retention based on confirmation:

* 48 hours for false-positive retention
* 5 days for true-positive retention
a| Administrators can perform a clear-suspect action which sets retention based on confirmation:

* 24 hours for false-positive retention
* 7 days for true-positive retention

| Expiration notification
| None
| An expiration time is set for all snapshots to alert the administrator
//to be verified if visible in System Manager

== How to recover data in ONTAP after a ransomware attack

ARP builds on proven ONTAP data protection and disaster recovery technology to respond to ransomware attacks. When an attack is suspected, the system takes a point-in-time volume snapshot and locks that copy. If the attack is confirmed later, the volume can be restored using the ARP snapshot.

Locked snapshots cannot be deleted by normal means. However, if you decide later to mark the attack as a false positive, the locked copy will be deleted. 

With the knowledge of the affected files and the time of attack, it is possible to selectively recover the affected files from various snapshots rather than simply reverting the whole volume to one of the snapshots.

See the following topics for more information on recovering data:

* link:../data-protection/restore-contents-volume-snapshot-task.html[Recover from snapshots]

* link:https://www.netapp.com/blog/smart-ransomware-recovery[Smart ransomware recovery^]

== Multi-admin verification protection for ARP

Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, it's recommended that you enable multi-admin verification (MAV) so that two or more authenticated user admins are required for Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP) configuration. For more information, see link:../multi-admin-verify/enable-disable-task.html[Enable multi-admin verification].

[[arp-ai]]
== Autonomous Ransomware Protection with Artificial Intelligence (ARP/AI) 

Beginning with ONTAP 9.16.1, ARP improves cyber resiliency by adopting a machine-learning model for anti-ransomware analytics that detects constantly evolving forms of ransomware with 99% accuracy in NAS environments (98% for SAN environments beginning with ONTAP 9.17.1). ARP's machine-learning model is pre-trained on a large dataset of files both before and after a simulated ransomware attack. This resource-intensive training is done outside ONTAP, but the learning from this training is used for the ONTAP model. 

.Immediate transition to active protection for ARP/AI with FlexVol volumes

With ARP/AI and FlexVol volumes, there is no <<Learning and active modes,learning period>>. ARP/AI is enabled and active immediately after installation or upgrade to 9.16. After upgrading your cluster to ONTAP 9.16.1, ARP/AI will be automatically enabled for existing and new FlexVol volumes if ARP is already enabled for those volumes. 

link:enable-arp-ai-with-au.html[Learn more about enabling ARP/AI]

.ARP/AI automatic updates

To keep up-to-date protection against the latest ransomware threats, ARP/AI offers frequent automatic updates that occur outside of regular ONTAP upgrade and release cadences. If you have link:../update/enable-automatic-updates-task.html[enabled automatic updates] then you will also be able to start receiving automatic security updates to ARP/AI after you select automatic updates for security files. You can also choose to make these updates manually and control when the updates occur.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.16.1, security updates for ARP/AI are available using System Manager in addition to system and firmware updates.
