Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, the Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP) feature uses workload analysis in NAS (NFS and SMB) environments to proactively detect and warn about abnormal activity that might indicate a ransomware attack. When an attack is suspected, ARP also creates new snapshots in addition to the existing protection provided by scheduled snapshots.

== Autonomous Ransomware Protection with Artificial Intelligence (ARP/AI) 

Beginning with ONTAP 9.16.1, ARP improves cyber resiliency by adopting a machine-learning model for anti-ransomware analytics that detects constantly evolving forms of ransomware with 99% accuracy. ARP's machine-learning model is pre-trained on a large dataset of files both before and after a simulated ransomware attack. This resource-intensive training is done outside ONTAP, but the learning from this training is used for the model inside ONTAP. 

.Immediate transition to active protection for ARP/AI with FlexVol volumes

With ARP/AI and FlexVol volumes, there is no <<Learning and active modes,learning period>>. ARP/AI begins is enabled and active immediately after installation or upgrade to 9.16. After upgrading your cluster to ONTAP 9.16.1, ARP/AI will be automatically enabled for existing and new FlexVol volumes if ARP is already enabled for those volumes.

.ARP/AI automatic updates

To keep up-to-date protection against the latest ransomware threats, ARP/AI offers frequent automatic updates that occur outside of regular ONTAP upgrade and release cadences. If you have link:../update/enable-automatic-updates-task.html[enabled automatic updates] then you will also be able to start receiving automatic security updates to ARP/AI after you select automatic updates for security files. You can also choose to make these updates manually and control when the updates occur.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.16.1, security updates for ARP/AI are available using System Manager in addition to system and firmware updates.

IMPORTANT: The ARP/AI feature currently supports only NAS. Although the automatic update capability displays the availability of new security files for deployment in System Manager, these updates are only applicable for NAS workload protection.

== Licenses and enablement 

ARP support is included with the link:https://kb.netapp.com/onprem/ontap/os/ONTAP_9.10.1_and_later_licensing_overview[ONTAP ONE license^]. If you do not have the ONTAP One license, other licenses are available to use ARP that differ depending on your version of ONTAP. 

[cols="2*",options="header"]
|===
| ONTAP releases| License
a| ONTAP 9.11.1 and later a| Anti_ransomware
a| ONTAP 9.10.1 a| MT_EK_MGMT (Multi-Tenant Key Management)
|===

* If you are upgrading from ONTAP 9.10.1 to ONTAP 9.11.1 or later and ARP is already configured on your system, you do not need to install the new Anti-ransomware license. For new ARP configurations, the new license is required.
* If you are reverting from ONTAP 9.11.1 or later to ONTAP 9.10.1, and you have enabled ARP with the Anti-ransomware license, you will see a warning message and might need to reconfigure ARP.

== ONTAP ransomware protection strategy

An effective ransomware detection strategy should include more than a single layer of protection.

An analogy would be the safety features of a vehicle. You don't rely on a single feature, such as a seatbelt, to completely protect you in an accident. Air bags, anti-lock brakes, and forward-collision warning are all additional safety features that will lead to a much better outcome. Ransomware protection should be viewed in the same way.

While ONTAP includes features like FPolicy, snapshots, SnapLock, and Active IQ Digital Advisor (also known as Digital Advisor) to help protect from ransomware, the following information focuses on the ARP on-box feature with machine learning capabilities.

To learn more about ONTAP's other anti-ransomware features, see link:../ransomware-solutions/ransomware-overview.html[Ransomware and NetApp's protection portfolio].

== What ARP detects

ARP is designed to protect against denial-of-service attacks where the attacker withholds data until a ransom is paid. ARP offers real-time ransomware detection based on: 

* Identification of the incoming data as encrypted or plaintext.
* Analytics that detect:
+
** **Entropy**: An evaluation of the randomness of data in a file
** **File extension types**: An extension that does not conform to the normal extension type
** **File IOPS**: A surge in abnormal volume activity with data encryption (beginning in ONTAP 9.11.1)

ARP can detect the spread of most ransomware attacks after only a small number of files are encrypted, take action automatically to protect data, and alert you that a suspected attack is happening.

[NOTE]
No ransomware detection or prevention system can completely guarantee safety from a ransomware attack. Although it's possible an attack might go undetected, ARP acts as an important additional layer of defense if anti-virus software has failed to detect an intrusion.

== Learning and active modes

For all ARP running with ONTAP 9.10.1 to 9.15.1 and ARP used for FlexGroup volumes with ONTAP 9.16.1, ARP has two modes: 

* *Learning mode* (or "dry run" mode)
* *Active mode* (or "enabled" mode)

NOTE: With ARP/AI beginning in ONTAP 9.16.1, there is no learning period when ARP is used with FlexVol volumes. ARP/AI on FlexVol volumes is enabled and active immediately after installation or upgrade to 9.16.1. If you are using ONTAP 9.16.1 and ARP with FlexGroup volumes, a learning period is still necessary prior to transition to active mode. 

.Learning mode
For all ARP running with ONTAP 9.10.1 to 9.15.1 and ARP used for FlexGroup volumes with ONTAP 9.16.1, when you enable ARP it runs in _learning mode_. In learning mode, the ONTAP system develops an alert profile based on the analytic areas: entropy, file extension types, and file IOPS. After running ARP in learning mode for enough time to assess workload characteristics, you can switch to active mode and start protecting your data.

It's recommended you leave ARP in learning mode for 30 days. Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, ARP automatically determines the optimal learning interval and automates the switch, which may occur before 30 days.

TIP: The command `security anti-ransomware volume workload-behavior show` shows file extensions that have been detected in the volume. If you run this command early in learning mode and it shows an accurate representation of file types, you should not use that data as a basis to move to active mode, as ONTAP is still collecting other metrics. 

.Active mode

For ARP running with ONTAP 9.10.1 to 9.15.1, ARP switches to _active mode_ after the optimal learning interval is completed. After ARP has switched to active mode, ONTAP creates ARP snapshots to protect the data if a threat is detected. 

In active mode, if a file extension is flagged as abnormal, you should evaluate the alert. You can act on the alert to protect your data or you can mark the alert as a false positive. Marking an alert as a false positive updates the alert profile. For example, if the alert is triggered by a new file extension and you mark the alert as a false positive, you will not receive an alert the next time that file extension is observed. 

NOTE: Beginning in ONTAP 9.11.1, you can customize the detection parameters for ARP. For more information, see xref:manage-parameters-task.html[manage ARP attack detection parameters].

== Threat assessment and ARP snapshots

When active and not in learning mode, ARP assesses threat probability based on incoming data measured against learned analytics. A measurement is assigned when ARP detects a threat:

* *Low*: The earliest detection of an abnormality in the volume (for example, a new file extension is observed in the volume). This level of detection is only available in versions prior to ONTAP 9.16.1 that do not have ARP/AI.
* *Moderate*: Multiple files with the same never-seen-before file extension are observed.

** In ONTAP 9.10.1, the threshold for escalation to moderate is 100 or more files.
** Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, the file quantity is modifiable; its default value is 20. 

In a low threat situation, ONTAP detects an abnormality and creates a snapshot of the volume to create the best recovery point. ONTAP prepends the name of the ARP snapshot with `Anti-ransomware-backup` to make it easily identifiable; for example, `Anti_ransomware_backup.2022-12-20_1248`. 

The threat escalates to moderate after ONTAP runs an analytics report determining if the abnormality matches a ransomware profile. When the attack probability is moderate, ONTAP generates an EMS notification prompting you to assess the threat. ONTAP does not send alerts about low threats, however, beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can xref:manage-parameters-task.html#modify-alerts[modify alerts settings]. For more information, see xref:respond-abnormal-task.html[Respond to abnormal activity].

You can view information about moderate threats in System Manager's *Events* section or with the `security anti-ransomware volume show` command. Low threat events can also be viewed using the `security anti-ransomware volume show` command in versions prior to ONTAP 9.16.1 that do not have ARP/AI.

Individual ARP snapshots are retained for two days. If there are multiple ARP snapshots, they are retained for five days by default. Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, you can modify the retention settings. For more information, see xref:modify-automatic-shapshot-options-task.html[Modify options for snapshots].

== How to recover data in ONTAP after a ransomware attack

When an attack is suspected, the system takes a volume snapshot at that point in time and locks that copy. If the attack is confirmed later, the volume can be restored using the ARP snapshot.

Locked snapshots cannot be deleted by normal means. However, if you decide later to mark the attack as a false positive, the locked copy will be deleted. 

With the knowledge of the affected files and the time of attack, it is possible to selectively recover the affected files from various snapshots rather than simply reverting the whole volume to one of the snapshots.

ARP thus builds on proven ONTAP data protection and disaster recovery technology to respond to ransomware attacks. See the following topics for more information on recovering data.

* link:../data-protection/restore-contents-volume-snapshot-task.html[Recover from snapshots]

* link:https://www.netapp.com/blog/smart-ransomware-recovery[Smart ransomware recovery^]

== Multi-admin verification protection for ARP

Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, it's recommended that you enable multi-admin verification (MAV) so that two or more authenticated user admins are required for Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP) configuration. For more information, see link:../multi-admin-verify/enable-disable-task.html[Enable multi-admin verification].
