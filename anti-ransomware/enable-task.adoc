Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can enable Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP) on an existing volume or create a new volume and enable ARP from the beginning.

If you want to configure your ONTAP cluster so that all new volumes will be enabled by default for Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP), see this link:enable-default-task.html[related ARP procedure].

.About this task

* *For ONTAP 9.10.1 to 9.15.1 and ARP with FlexGroup volumes* 
For these versions of ONTAP, you should always enable ARP initially in link:index.html#learning-and-active-modes[learning mode] (or "dry-run" mode). When you first enable ARP in learning mode, the system analyzes the workload to characterize normal behavior. Beginning in active mode can lead to excessive false positive reports.
+
It's recommended you let ARP run in learning mode for a minimum of 30 days. Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, ARP automatically determines the optimal learning period interval and automates the switch, which might occur before 30 days.

* *For ONTAP 9.16.1 and later with FlexVol volumes*
When you enable ARP, ARP/AI protection is enabled and active immediately. No learning period is required.

.Before you begin

* You must have a storage VM (SVM) enabled for NFS or SMB (or both).
* The xref:index.html#licenses-and-enablement[correct license] must be installed for your ONTAP version.
* You must have NAS workload with clients configured.
* The volume you want to set ARP on must be protected and have an active link:../concepts/namespaces-junction-points-concept.html[junction path].
* The volume must be less than 100% full.
* It's recommended you configure the EMS system to send email notifications, which will include notices of ARP activity. For more information, see link:../error-messages/configure-ems-events-send-email-task.html[Configure EMS events to send email notifications].
* Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, it's recommended that you enable multi-admin verification (MAV) so that two or more authenticated user admins are required for Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP) configuration. For more information, see link:../multi-admin-verify/enable-disable-task.html[Enable multi-admin verification].

== Enable ARP on a new or existing volume

You can enable ARP using System Manager or the ONTAP CLI. 

[role="tabbed-block"]
====
.System Manager
--
.Steps
. Select *Storage > Volumes*, then select the volume you want to protect.
. In the *Security* tab of the *Volumes* overview, select *Status* to switch from Disabled to Enabled. 

* If you are using ARP with ONTAP 9.15.1 or earlier or ONTAP 9.16.1 with FlexGroup volumes, select *Enabled in learning-mode* in the *Anti-ransomware* box.
+
NOTE: Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, ARP automatically determines the optimal learning period interval and automates the switch. You can link:enable-default-task.html[disable this setting on the associated storage VM] if you want to control the learning mode to active mode transition manually.
+
[NOTE]
In existing volumes, learning and active modes only apply to newly written data, not to already existing data in the volume. The existing data is not scanned and analyzed, because the characteristics of earlier normal data traffic are assumed based on the new data after the volume is enabled for ARP.

* If you are using ARP on FlexVol volumes with ONTAP 9.16.1 or later, ARP/AI functionality is enabled and active immediately. No learning period is required.

. You can verify the ARP state of the volume in the *Anti-ransomware* box.
+
To display ARP status for all volumes: In the *Volumes* pane, select *Show/Hide* then ensure that *Anti-ransomware* status is checked.

.CLI
--

The process to enable ARP with the CLI differs if you are enabling it on an existing volume versus a new volume. 

.Enable ARP on an existing volume

. Modify an existing volume to enable ransomware protection:
+
[source, cli]
----
security anti-ransomware volume dry-run -volume <vol_name> -vserver <svm_name>
----
+
For ONTAP 9.15.1 and earlier and FlexGroup volumes, new volumes begin in learning mode. For ONTAP 9.16.1 and later with FlexVol volumes, ARP/AI is enabled immediately. In either case, use `dry-run` as the value.
+
Learn more about `security anti-ransomware volume dry-run` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/security-anti-ransomware-volume-dry-run.html[ONTAP command reference^].

. If you upgraded to ONTAP 9.13.1 through ONTAP 9.15.1 and the default state is `dry-run`, adaptive learning is enabled so that the change to `active` state is done automatically. If you do not want this behavior to be automatically enabled, change the setting at the SVM level on all associated volumes:
+
[source, cli]
----
vserver modify <svm_name> -anti-ransomware-auto-switch-from-learning-to-enabled false
----

. Verify the ARP state of the volume.
+
[source, cli]
----
security anti-ransomware volume show
----
//does this work for 9161 if it just shows dry-run? Maybe we need to verify ONTAP version or other AI behavior.

.Enable ARP on a new volume

. Create a new volume with ARP enabled before provisioning data:
+
[source, cli]
----
volume create -volume <vol_name> -vserver <svm_name> -aggregate <aggr_name> -size <nn> -anti-ransomware-state dry-run -junction-path </path_name>
----
+
For ONTAP 9.15.1 and earlier and FlexGroup volumes, new volumes begin in learning mode. For ONTAP 9.16.1 and later with FlexVol volumes, ARP/AI is enabled immediately. In either case, use `dry-run` as the value. 

. If you upgraded to ONTAP 9.13.1 through ONTAP 9.15.1 and the default state is `dry-run`, adaptive learning is enabled so that the change to `active` state is done automatically. If you do not want this behavior to be automatically enabled, change the setting at the SVM level on all associated volumes:
+
[source, cli]
----
vserver modify <svm_name> -anti-ransomware-auto-switch-from-learning-to-enabled false
----

. Verify that the volume is set to `enabled` state.
+
[source, cli]
----
security anti-ransomware volume show
----
+
