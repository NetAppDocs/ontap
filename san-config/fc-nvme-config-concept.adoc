Beginning with ONTAP 9.4, the non-volatile memory express (NVMe) protocol is available for SAN environments. FC-NVMe allows you to run NVMe over an existing FC network with an AFF system. FC-NVMe uses the same physical setup and zoning practice as traditional FC networks but allows for greater bandwidth, increased IOPs and reduced latency than FC-SCSI.

Supported configurations:

* NVMe is supported on AFF platforms that have 32G FC ports.
* You can set up your FC-NVMe configuration with single nodes or HA pairs using a single fabric or multifabric.
* Beginning in ONTAP 9.11.1, NVMe is supported on clusters with up to 12 nodes.  Beginning in ONTAP 9.4, NVMe is supported on clusters with up to 4 nodes. 
* NVMe can be the only data protocol on the storage virtual machine (SVM).
* Up to 8 NVMe SVMs are supported per cluster.
* FC-NVMe can be the only data protocol on data LIFs.
* LUNs and namespaces cannot be mixed on the same volume.
* You should configure one management LIF for every SVM supporting SAN.
* The use of heterogeneous FC switch fabrics is not supported, except in the case of embedded blade switches.
+
Specific exceptions are listed on the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^].

* Cascade, partial mesh, full mesh, core-edge, and director fabrics are all industry-standard methods of connecting FC switches to a fabric, and all are supported.
+
A fabric can consist of one or multiple switches, and the storage controllers can be connected to multiple switches.

Functionality enhancements:

|===

h| This functionality is supported... h| Starting with...

| volume move with mapped namespaces | ONTAP 9.6
| Namespaces support 512 byte blocks and 4096 byte blocks. +
4096 is the default value. 512 should only be used if the host operating system does not support 4096 byte blocks. | ONTAP 9.6
| Multipath HA pair failover/giveback | ONTAP 9.5

|===

The following applies only to nodes running ONTAP 9.4:

* NVMe LIFs and namespaces must be hosted on the same node.
* The NVMe service must be created before the NVMe LIF is created.

The following ONTAP features are not supported by NVMe configurations:

* NVMe namespace move
* NVMe namespaces (Copy on Demand)
* Creating namespaces on a volume transitioned from Data ONTAP operating in 7-mode.
* Sync
* Virtual Storage Console
