[.lead]
Fibre Channel switches have maximum configuration limits, including the number of logins supported per port, port group, blade, and switch. The switch vendors document their supported limits.

Each FC logical interface (LIF) logs into an FC switch port. The total number of logins from a single target on the node equals the number of LIFs plus one login for the underlying physical port. Do not exceed the switch vendor's configuration limits for logins or other configuration values. This also holds true for the initiators being used on the host side in virtualized environments with NPIV enabled. Do not exceed the switch vendor's configuration limits for logins for either the target or the initiators being used in the solution.
