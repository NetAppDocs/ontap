Certain combinations of FCoE and traditional FC initiators and targets are supported.

== FCoE initiators

You can use FCoE initiators in host computers with both FCoE and traditional FC targets in storage controllers. The host FCoE initiator must connect to an FCoE DCB (data center bridging) switch; direct connection to a target is not supported.

The following table lists the supported combinations:

== FCoE targets

You can mix FCoE target ports with 4-Gb, 8-Gb, or 16-Gb FC ports on the storage controller regardless of whether the FC ports are add-in target adapters or onboard ports. You can have both FCoE and FC target adapters in the same storage controller.

[NOTE]
====
The rules for combining onboard and expansion FC ports still apply.
