[.lead]
The hop count is defined as the number of switches in the path between the initiator (host) and target (storage system). The maximum supported FC hop count between a host and storage system varies depending on the switch supplier.

Documentation from Cisco Systems also refers to this value as the _diameter of the SAN fabric_.  

For FCoE, you can have FCoE switches connected to FC switches.  For end-to-end FCoE connections, the FCoE switches must be running a firmware version that supports Ethernet inter-switch links (ISLs).
