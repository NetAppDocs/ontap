[.lead]
You can use FC commands to manage FC target adapters, FC initiator adapters, and onboard FC adapters for your storage controller. The same commands are used to manage FC adapters for the FC protocol and the FC-NVMe protocol.

FC initiator adapter commands work only at the node level. You must use the `run -node _node_name_` command before you can use the FC initiator adapter commands.
