The Previous Versions functionality is always available, provided that client access to Snapshot copies is enabled and provided that Snapshot copies exist. If your snapshot configuration does not meet these requirements, you can create a snapshot configuration that does.

.Steps

. If the volume containing the share to which you want to allow Previous Versions access does not have an associated Snapshot policy, associate a Snapshot policy to the volume and enable it by using the `volume modify` command.
+
For more information about using the `volume modify` command, see the man pages.

. Enable access to the Snapshot copies by using the `volume modify` command to set the `-snap-dir` option to `true`.
+
For more information about using the `volume modify` command, see the man pages.

. Verify that Snapshot policies are enabled and that access to Snapshot directories is enabled by using the `volume show` and `volume snapshot policy show` commands.
+
For more information about using the `volume show` and `volume snapshot policy show` commands, see the man pages.
