The Previous Versions functionality is always available, provided that client access to snapshots is enabled and provided that snapshots exist. If your snapshot configuration does not meet these requirements, you can create a snapshot configuration that does.

.Steps

. If the volume containing the share to which you want to allow Previous Versions access does not have an associated snapshot policy, associate a snapshot policy to the volume and enable it by using the `volume modify` command.
