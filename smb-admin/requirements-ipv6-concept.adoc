Before you can use IPv6 on your SMB server, you need to know which versions of ONTAP and SMB support it and what the license requirements are.

== ONTAP license requirements

No special license is required for IPv6 when SMB is licensed. The SMB license is included with link:../system-admin/manage-licenses-concept.html#licenses-included-with-ontap-one[ONTAP One]. If you don't have ONTAP One and the license is not installed, contact your sales representative. 

== SMB protocol version requirements

* For SVMs, ONTAP supports IPv6 on all versions of the SMB protocol.

[NOTE]
====
NetBIOS name service (NBNS) over IPv6 is not supported.
