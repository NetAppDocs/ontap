Applying an audit policy to SVMs is the last step in creating and applying NTFS ACLs to files or folders.

.About this task

You can apply security settings defined in the security policy to NTFS files and folders residing within FlexVol volumes (NTFS or mixed security style).

NOTE: When an audit policy and associated SACLs are applied, any existing DACLs are overwritten. When a security policy and its associated DACLs are applied, any existing DACLs are overwritten. You should review existing security policies before creating and applying new ones.

.Step

. Apply a security policy: `vserver security file-directory apply -vserver vserver_name -policy-name policy_name`
+
`vserver security file-directory apply -vserver vs1 -policy-name policy1`
+
The policy apply job is scheduled and the Job ID is returned.
