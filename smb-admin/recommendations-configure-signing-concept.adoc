You can configure SMB signing behavior between SMB clients and the CIFS server to meet your security requirements. The settings you choose when configuring SMB signing on your CIFS server are dependent on what your security requirements are.

You can configure SMB signing on either the client or the CIFS server. Consider the following recommendations when configuring SMB signing:

a|
Make SMB signing required on the CIFS server by configuring the security settings to require SMB signing.
