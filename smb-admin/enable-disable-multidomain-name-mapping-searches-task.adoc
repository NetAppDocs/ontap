With multidomain name mapping searches, you can use a wild card (\*) in the domain portion of a Windows name when configuring UNIX user to Windows user name mapping. Using a wild card (*) in the domain portion of the name enables ONTAP to search all domains that have a bidirectional trust with the domain that contains the CIFS server's computer account.

.About this task

As an alternative to searching all bidirectionally trusted domains, you can configure a list of preferred trusted domains. When a list of preferred trusted domains is configured, ONTAP uses the preferred trusted domain list instead of the discovered bidirectionally trusted domains to perform multidomain name mapping searches.

* Multidomain name mapping searches are enabled by default.
* This option is available at the advanced privilege level.

.Steps

. Set the privilege level to advanced: `set -privilege advanced`
. Perform one of the following actions:
