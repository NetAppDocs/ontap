If you want to manipulate UNIX permissions of files or folders in mixed security-style volumes or qtrees on SVMs, you can use the Security tab on Windows clients. Alternatively, you can use applications that can query and set Windows ACLs.

* Modifying UNIX permissions
+
You can use the Windows Security tab to view and change UNIX permissions for a mixed security-style volume or qtree. If you use the main Windows Security tab to change UNIX permissions, you must first remove the existing ACE you want to edit (this sets the mode bits to 0) before you make your changes. Alternatively, you can use the Advanced editor to change permissions.
+
If mode permissions are used, you can directly change the mode permissions for the listed UID, GID, and others (everyone else with an account on the computer). For example, if the displayed UID has r-x permissions, you can change the UID permissions to rwx.

* Changing UNIX permissions to NTFS permissions
+
You can use the Windows Security tab to replace UNIX security objects with Windows security objects on a mixed security-style volume or qtree where the files and folders have a UNIX effective security style.
+
You must first remove all listed UNIX permission entries before you can replace them with the desired Windows User and Group objects. You can then configure NTFS-based ACLs on the Windows User and Group objects. By removing all UNIX security objects and adding only Windows Users and Groups to a file or folder in a mixed security-style volume or qtree, you change the effective security style on the file or folder from UNIX to NTFS.
+
When changing permissions on a folder, the default Windows behavior is to propagate these changes to all subfolders and files. Therefore, you must change the propagation choice to the desired setting if you do not want to propagate a change in security style to all child folders, subfolders, and files.
