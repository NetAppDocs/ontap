[.lead]
You can delete local user accounts from your storage virtual machine (SVM) if they are no longer needed for local SMB authentication to the CIFS server or for determining access rights to data contained on your SVM.

.About this task

Keep the following in mind when deleting local users:

* The file system is not altered.
+
Windows Security Descriptors on files and directories that refer to this user are not adjusted.

* All references to local users are removed from the membership and privileges databases.
* Standard, well-known users such as Administrator cannot be deleted.

.Steps

. Determine the name of the local user account that you want to delete: `vserver cifs users-and-groups local-user show -vserver _vserver_name_`
. Delete the local user: `vserver cifs users-and-groups local-user delete -vserver _vserver_name_ â€‘user-name _username_name_`
. Verify that the user account is deleted: `vserver cifs users-and-groups local-user show -vserver _vserver_name_`

.Example

The following example deletes the local user "`CIFS_SERVER\sue`" associated with SVM vs1:

----
cluster1::> vserver cifs users-and-groups local-user show -vserver vs1
Vserver  User Name                   Full Name      Description
-------- --------------------------- -------------- -------------
vs1      CIFS_SERVER\Administrator   James Smith    Built-in administrator account
vs1      CIFS_SERVER\sue             Sue   Jones


cluster1::> vserver cifs users-and-groups local-user delete -vserver vs1 -user-name CIFS_SERVER\sue

cluster1::> vserver cifs users-and-groups local-user show -vserver vs1
Vserver      User Name                   Full Name      Description
-------- --------------------------- -------------- -------------
vs1      CIFS_SERVER\Administrator   James Smith    Built-in administrator account
