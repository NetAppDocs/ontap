ONTAP BranchCache provides support for BranchCache Group Policy Objects (GPOs), which allow centralized management for certain BranchCache configuration parameters. There are two GPOs used for BranchCache, the Hash Publication for BranchCache GPO and the Hash Version Support for BranchCache GPO.

* *Hash Publication for BranchCache GPO*
+
The Hash Publication for BranchCache GPO corresponds to the `-operating-mode` parameter. When GPO updates occur, this value is applied to storage virtual machine (SVM) objects contained within the organizational unit (OU) to which the group policy applies.

* *Hash Version Support for BranchCache GPO*
+
The Hash Version Support for BranchCache GPO corresponds to the `-versions` parameter. When GPO updates occur, this value is applied to SVM objects contained within the organizational unit to which the group policy applies.
