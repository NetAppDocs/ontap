summary: "To take advantage of the strongest security with Kerberos-based communication, you can enable AES-256 and AES-128 encryption on the SMB server. If you do not want the SMB server to select the AES encryption types for Kerberos-based communication with the Active Directory (AD) KDC, you can disable AES encryption. By default, AES encryption is disabled."

[.lead]
To take advantage of the strongest security with Kerberos-based communication, you should use AES-256 and AES-128 encryption on the SMB server. Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, AES encryption is enabled by default.  If you do not want the SMB server to select the AES encryption types for Kerberos-based communication with the Active Directory (AD) KDC, you can disable AES encryption.

Whether AES encryption is enabled by default and whether you have the option to specify encryption types depends on your ONTAP version.

[cols="3" options="header"]
|===

| ONTAP version
| AES encryption is enabled ...
| You can specify encryption types?

| 9.13.1 and later
| By default
| Yes

| 9.12.1
| Manually
| Yes

| 9.11.1 and earlier
| Manually
| No

|===

Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, AES encryption is enabled and disabled using the `-advertised-enc-types` option, which allows you to specify the encryption types advertised to the AD KDC. The default setting is `rc4` and `des`, but when an AES type is specified, AES encryption is enabled. You can also use the option to explicitly disable the weaker RC4 and DES encryption types. In ONTAP 9.11.1 and earlier, you must use the `-is-aes-encryption-enabled` option to enable and disable AES encryption, and encryption types cannot be specified.

To enhance security, the storage virtual machine (SVM) changes its machine account password in the AD each time the AES security option is modified. Changing the password might require administrative AD credentials for the organizational unit (OU) that contains the machine account.

If an SVM is configured as a disaster recovery destination where the identity is not preserved (the `-identity-preserve` option is set to `false` in the SnapMirror configuration), the non-default SMB server security settings are not replicated to the destination. If you have enabled AES encryption on the source SVM, you must manually enable it.

.Steps

[role="tabbed-block"]
====
.ONTAP 9.12.1 and later
--

. Perform one of the following actions:
+
[options="header"]
|===
| If you want the AES encryption types for Kerberos communication to be...| Enter the command...
a|
Enabled
a|
`vserver cifs security modify -vserver vserver_name -advertised-enc-types aes-128,aes-256`
a|
Disabled
a|
`vserver cifs security modify -vserver vserver_name -advertised-enc-types des,rc4`
|===
+
*Note:* The `-is-aes-encryption-enabled` option is deprecated in ONTAP 9.12.1 and might be removed in a later release.

. Verify that AES encryption is enabled or disabled as desired: `vserver cifs security show -vserver vserver_name -fields advertised-enc-types`

.Examples

The following example enables the AES encryption types for the SMB server on SVM vs1:

----
cluster1::> vserver cifs security modify -vserver vs1 -advertised-enc-types aes-128,aes-256

cluster1::> vserver cifs security show -vserver vs1 -fields advertised-enc-types

vserver  advertised-enc-types
-------- --------------------
vs1      aes-128,aes-256
----

The following example enables the AES encryption types for the SMB server on SVM vs2. The administrator is prompted to enter the administrative AD credentials for the OU containing the SMB server.

----
cluster1::> vserver cifs security modify -vserver vs2 -advertised-enc-types aes-128,aes-256

Info: In order to enable SMB AES encryption, the password for the SMB server
machine account must be reset. Enter the username and password for the
SMB domain "EXAMPLE.COM".

Enter your user ID: administrator

Enter your password:

cluster1::> vserver cifs security show -vserver vs2 -fields advertised-enc-types

vserver  advertised-enc-types
-------- --------------------
vs2      aes-128,aes-256
----

--

.ONTAP 9.11.1 and earlier
--

. Perform one of the following actions:
+
[options="header"]
|===
| If you want the AES encryption types for Kerberos communication to be...| Enter the command...
a|
Enabled
a|
`vserver cifs security modify -vserver vserver_name -is-aes-encryption-enabled true`
a|
Disabled
a|
`vserver cifs security modify -vserver vserver_name -is-aes-encryption-enabled false`
|===

. Verify that AES encryption is enabled or disabled as desired: `vserver cifs security show -vserver vserver_name -fields is-aes-encryption-enabled`
+
The `is-aes-encryption-enabled` field displays `true` if AES encryption is enabled and `false` if it is disabled.

.Examples

The following example enables the AES encryption types for the SMB server on SVM vs1:

----
cluster1::> vserver cifs security modify -vserver vs1 -is-aes-encryption-enabled true

cluster1::> vserver cifs security show -vserver vs1 -fields is-aes-encryption-enabled

vserver  is-aes-encryption-enabled
-------- -------------------------
vs1      true                     
----

The following example enables the AES encryption types for the SMB server on SVM vs2. The administrator is prompted to enter the administrative AD credentials for the OU containing the SMB server.

----
cluster1::> vserver cifs security modify -vserver vs2 -is-aes-encryption-enabled true

Info: In order to enable SMB AES encryption, the password for the CIFS server
machine account must be reset. Enter the username and password for the
SMB domain "EXAMPLE.COM".

Enter your user ID: administrator

Enter your password:

cluster1::> vserver cifs security show -vserver vs2 -fields is-aes-encryption-enabled

vserver  is-aes-encryption-enabled
-------- -------------------------
vs2      true
