You can assign privileges directly to local users or domain users. Alternatively, you can assign users to local groups whose assigned privileges match the capabilities that you want those users to have.

You then add a user to the group that has the privileges that you want that user to have.

* You can also assign local users and domain users to predefined groups whose default privileges match the privileges that you want to grant to those users.
