You can manage NTFS file security, NTFS audit policies, and Storage-Level Access Guard on storage virtual machines (SVMs) by using the CLI.

You can manage NTFS file security and audit policies from SMB clients or by using the CLI. However, using the CLI to configure file security and audit policies removes the need to use a remote client to manage file security. Using the CLI can significantly reduce the time it takes to apply security on many files and folders using a single command.

You can configure Storage-Level Access Guard, which is another layer of security applied by ONTAP to SVM volumes. Storage-Level Access Guard applies to accesses from all NAS protocols to the storage object to which Storage-Level Access Guard is applied.

Storage-Level Access Guard can be configured and managed only from the ONTAP CLI. You cannot manage Storage-Level Access Guard settings from SMB clients. Moreover, if you view the security settings on a file or directory from an NFS or SMB client, you will not see the Storage-Level Access Guard security. Storage-Level Access Guard security cannot be revoked from a client, even by a system (Windows or UNIX) administrator. Therefore, Storage-Level Access Guard provides an extra layer of security for data access that is independently set and managed by the storage administrator.

NOTE: Even though only NTFS access permissions are supported for Storage-Level Access Guard, ONTAP can perform security checks for access over NFS to data on volumes where Storage-Level Access Guard is applied if the UNIX user maps to a Windows user on the SVM that owns the volume.

== NTFS security-style volumes

All files and folders contained within NTFS security-style volumes and qtrees have NTFS effective security. You can use the `vserver security file-directory` command family to implement the following types of security on NTFS security-style volumes:

* File permissions and audit policies to files and folders contained in the volume
* Storage-Level Access Guard security on volumes

== Mixed security-style volumes

Mixed security-style volumes and qtrees can contain some files and folders that have UNIX effective security and use UNIX file permissions, either mode bits or NFSv4.x ACLs and NFSv4.x audit policies, and some files and folders that have NTFS effective security and use NTFS file permissions and audit policies. You can use the `vserver security file-directory` command family to apply the following types of security to mixed security-style data:

* File permissions and audit policies to files and folders with NTFS effective security-style in the mixed volume or qtree
* Storage-Level Access Guard to volumes with either NTFS and UNIX effective security-style

== UNIX security-style volumes

UNIX security-style volumes and qtrees contain files and folders that have UNIX effective security (either mode bits or NFSv4.x ACLs). You must keep the following in mind if you want to use the `vserver security file-directory` command family to implement security on UNIX security-style volumes:

* The `vserver security file-directory` command family cannot be used to manage UNIX file security and audit policies on UNIX security-style volumes and qtrees.
* You can use the `vserver security file-directory` command family to configure Storage-Level Access Guard on UNIX security-style volumes, provided the SVM with the target volume contains a CIFS server.
