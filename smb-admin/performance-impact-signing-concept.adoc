When SMB sessions use SMB signing, all SMB communications to and from Windows clients experience a performance impact, which affects both the clients and the server (that is, the nodes on the cluster running the SVM containing the SMB server).

The performance impact shows as increased CPU usage on both the clients and the server, although the amount of network traffic does not change.

The extent of the performance impact depends on the version of ONTAP 9 you are running. Beginning with ONTAP 9.7, a new encryption off-load algorithm can enable better performance in signed SMB traffic. SMB signing offload is enabled by default when SMB signing is enabled.

Enhanced SMB signing performance requires AES-NI offload capability. See the Hardware Universe (HWU) to verify that AES-NI offload is supported for your platform.

Further performance improvements are also possible if you are able to use SMB version 3.11 which supports the much faster GCM algorithm.

Depending on your network, ONTAP 9 version, SMB version, and SVM implementation, the performance impact of SMB signing can vary widely; you can verify it only through testing in your network environment.

Most Windows clients negotiate SMB signing by default if it is enabled on the server. If you require SMB protection for some of your Windows clients, and if SMB signing is causing performance issues, you can disable SMB signing on any of your Windows clients that do not require protection against replay attacks. For information about disabling SMB signing on Windows clients, see the Microsoft Windows documentation.
