Because null session shares do not require authentication, clients that require null session access must have their IP addresses mapped on the storage system.

By default, unmapped null session clients can access certain ONTAP system services, such as share enumeration, but they are restricted from accessing any storage system data.

[NOTE]
====
ONTAP supports Windows RestrictAnonymous registry setting values with the `–restrict-anonymous` option. This enables you to control the extent to which unmapped null users can view or access system resources. For example, you can disable share enumeration and access to the IPC$ share (the hidden named pipe share). Learn more about `vserver cifs options modify` and `vserver cifs options show` and the `–restrict-anonymous` option in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/search.html?q=vserver+cifs+options[ONTAP command reference^].
====

Unless otherwise configured, a client running a local process that requests storage system access through a null session is a member only of nonrestrictive groups, such as "`everyone`". To limit null session access to selected storage system resources, you might want to create a group to which all null session clients belong; creating this group enables you to restrict storage system access and to set storage system resource permissions that apply specifically to null session clients.

ONTAP provides a mapping syntax in the `vserver name-mapping` command set to specify the IP address of clients allowed access to storage system resources using a null user session. After you create a group for null users, you can specify access restrictions for storage system resources and resource permissions that apply only to null sessions. Null user is identified as anonymous logon. Null users do not have access to any home directory.

Any null user accessing the storage system from a mapped IP address is granted mapped user permissions. Consider appropriate precautions to prevent unauthorized access to storage systems mapped with null users. For maximum protection, place the storage system and all clients requiring null user storage system access on a separate network, to eliminate the possibility of IP address "`spoofing`".
