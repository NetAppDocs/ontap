You configure BranchCache on your SMB server using ONTAP commands. To implement BranchCache, you must also configure your clients, and optionally your hosted cache servers at the branch offices where you want to cache content.

If you configure BranchCache to enable caching on a share-by-share basis, you must enable BranchCache on the SMB shares for which you want to provide BranchCache caching services.
