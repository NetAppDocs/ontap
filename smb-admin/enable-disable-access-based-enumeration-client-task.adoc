You can enable or disable access-based enumeration (ABE) on SMB shares from a Windows client, which allows you to configure this share setting without needing to connect to the CIFS server.

[NOTE]
The `abecmd` utility is not available in new versions of Windows Server and Windows clients. It was released as part of Windows Server 2008. Support ended for Windows Server 2008 on January 14, 2020. 

.Steps

. From a Windows client that supports ABE, enter the following command: `abecmd [/enable | /disable] [/server CIFS_server_name] {/all | share_name}`

For more information about the `abecmd` command, see your Windows client documentation.
