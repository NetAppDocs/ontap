There are certain guidelines you should keep in mind when using Previous Versions to restore folders that contain junction points.

When using Previous Versions to restore folders that have child folders that are junction points, the restore can fail with an `Access Denied` error.

You can determine whether the folder that you are attempting to restore contains a junction by using the `vol show` command with the `-parent` option. You can also use the `vserver security trace` commands to create detailed logs about file and folder access issues.
