Server Message Block (SMB) is a remote file-sharing protocol used by Microsoft Windows clients and servers. In ONTAP 9, all SMB versions are supported; however, default SMB 1.0 support depends on your ONTAP version. You should verify that the ONTAP SMB server supports the clients and functionality required in your environment.

The latest information about which SMB clients and domain controllers ONTAP supports is available in the _Interoperability Matrix Tool_.

SMB 2.0 and later versions are enabled by default for ONTAP 9 SMB servers, and can be enabled or disabled as needed. The following table shows SMB 1.0 support and default configuration.

[NOTE]
====
Default settings for SMB 1.0 and 2.0 connections to domain controllers also depend on the ONTAP version. Learn more about `vserver cifs security modify` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/vserver-cifs-security-modify.html[ONTAP command reference^]. For environments with existing CIFS servers running SMB 1.0, you should migrate to a later SMB version as soon as possible to prepare for security and compliance enhancements. Contact your NetApp representative for details.
