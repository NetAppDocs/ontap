You can create a data volume without specifying a junction point. The resultant volume is not automatically mounted, and is not available to configure for NAS access. You must mount the volume before you can configure SMB shares or NFS exports for that volume.

.Before you begin

The aggregate in which you want to create the volume must already exist.

.Steps

. Create the volume without a junction point by using the following command: `volume create -vserver _vserver_name_ -volume _volume_name_ -aggregate _aggregate_name_ -size {integer[KB|MB|GB|TB|PB]} -security-style {ntfs|unix|mixed}`
+
Specifying a volume security style is optional. If you do not specify a security style, ONTAP creates the volume with the same security style that is applied to the root volume of the storage virtual machine (SVM). However, the root volume's security style might not be the security style you want applied to the data volume. The recommendation is to specify the security style when you create the volume to minimize difficult-to-troubleshoot file-access issues.
+
There are many optional parameters that you can use to customize a data volume. 
Learn more about `volume create` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/volume-create.html[ONTAP command reference^].

. Verify that the volume was created without a junction point: `volume show -vserver _vserver_name_ -volume _volume_name_ -junction`

.Example

The following example creates a volume named "`sales`" located on SVM vs1 that is not mounted at a junction point:

----
cluster1::> volume create -vserver vs1 -volume sales -aggregate aggr3 -size 20GB
[Job 3406] Job succeeded: Successful

cluster1::> volume show -vserver vs1 -junction
                     Junction                 Junction
Vserver   Volume     Active   Junction Path   Path Source
--------- ---------- -------- --------------- -----------
vs1       data       true     /data           RW_volume
vs1       home4      true     /eng/home       RW_volume
vs1       vs1_root   -        /               -
vs1       sales      -        -               -
