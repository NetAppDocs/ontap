Before you enable SMB automatic node referrals, you should be aware that certain ONTAP functionality does not support referrals.

* The following types of volumes do not support SMB automatic node referrals:
 ** Read-only members of a load-sharing mirror
 ** Destination volume of a data-protection mirror
* Node referrals do not move alongside a LIF move.
+
If a client is using a referred connection over an SMB 2.x or SMB 3.0 connection and a data LIF moves nondisruptively, the client continues to use the same referred connection, even if the LIF is no longer local to the data.

* Node referrals do not move alongside a volume move.
+
If a client is using a referred connection over any SMB connection and a volume move occurs, the client continues to use the same referred connection, even if the volume is no longer located on the same node as the data LIF.
