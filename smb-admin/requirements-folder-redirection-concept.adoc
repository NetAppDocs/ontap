[.lead]
Before you can use Microsoft's folder redirection with your CIFS server, you need to know which versions of ONTAP and SMB and which Windows clients support the feature.

== ONTAP version requirements

ONTAP support Microsoft folder redirection.

== SMB protocol version requirements

For storage virtual machine (SVM), ONTAP supports Microsoft's folder redirection on all versions of SMB.

== Windows client requirements

Before a user can use Microsoft's folder redirection, the Windows client must support the feature.

For the latest information about which Windows clients support folder redirection, see the Interoperability Matrix.
