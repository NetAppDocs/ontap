[.lead]
Before creating an SVM that is configured as a disaster recovery destination where the identity is not preserved (the `-identity-preserve` option is set to `false` in the SnapMirror configuration), you should know about how SMB server security settings are managed on the destination SVM.

* Non-default SMB server security settings are not replicated to the destination.
+
When you create a SMB server on the destination SVM, all SMB server security settings are set to default values. When the SVM disaster recovery destination is initialized, updated, or resynced, the SMB server security settings on the source are not replicated to the destination.

* You must manually configure non-default SMB server security settings.
+
If you have non-default SMB server security settings configured on the source SVM, you must manually configure these same settings on the destination SVM after the destination becomes read-write (after the SnapMirror relationship is broken).
