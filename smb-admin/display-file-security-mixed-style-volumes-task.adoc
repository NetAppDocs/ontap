[.lead]
You can display information about file and directory security on mixed security-style volumes, including what the security style and effective security styles are, what permissions are applied, and information about UNIX owners and groups. You can use the results to validate your security configuration or to troubleshoot file access issues.

.About this task

You must supply the name of the storage virtual machine (SVM) and the path to the data whose file or folder security information you want to display. You can display the output in summary form or as a detailed list.

* Mixed security-style volumes and qtrees can contain some files and folders that use UNIX file permissions, either mode bits or NFSv4 ACLs, and some files and directories that use NTFS file permissions.
* The top level of a mixed security-style volume can have either UNIX or NTFS effective security.
* ACL output is displayed only for file and folders with NTFS or NFSv4 security.
+
This field is empty for files and directories using UNIX security that have only mode bit permissions applied (no NFSv4 ACLs).

* The owner and group output fields in the ACL output apply only in the case of NTFS security descriptors.
* Because Storage-Level Access Guard security can be configured on a mixed security-style volume or qtree even if the effective security style of the volume root or qtree is UNIX, output for a volume or qtree path where Storage-Level Access Guard is configured might display both UNIX file permissions and Storage-Level Access Guard ACLs.
* If the path entered in the command is to data with NTFS effective security, the output also displays information about Dynamic Access Control ACEs if Dynamic Access Control is configured for the given file or directory path.

.Step

. Display file and directory security settings with the desired level of detail:
+
[options="header"]
|===
| If you want to display information...| Enter the following command...
a|
In summary form
a|
`vserver security file-directory show -vserver vserver_name -path path`
a|
With expanded detail
a|
`vserver security file-directory show -vserver vserver_name -path path -expand-mask true`
|===

.Examples

The following example displays the security information about the path `/projects` in SVM vs1 in expanded-mask form. This mixed security-style path has UNIX effective security.
