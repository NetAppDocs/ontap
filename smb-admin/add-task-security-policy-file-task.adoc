Creating and adding a policy task to a security policy is the fourth step in configuring and applying ACLs to files or folders in SVMs. When you create the policy task, you associate the task with a security policy. You can add one or more task entries to a security policy.

.About this task

The security policy is a container for a task. A task refers to a single operation that can be done by a security policy to files or folders with NTFS or mixed security (or to a volume object if configuring Storage-Level Access Guard).

There are two types of tasks:

* File and directory tasks
+
Used to specify tasks that apply security descriptors to specified files and folders. ACLs applied through file and directory tasks can be managed with SMB clients or the ONTAP CLI.

* Storage-Level Access Guard tasks
+
Used to specify tasks that apply Storage-Level Access Guard security descriptors to a specified volume. ACLs applied through Storage-Level Access Guard tasks can be managed only through the ONTAP CLI.

A task contains definitions for the security configuration of a file (or folder) or set of files (or folders). Every task in a policy is uniquely identified by the path. There can be only one task per path within a single policy. A policy cannot have duplicate task entries.

Guidelines for adding a task to a policy:

* There can be a maximum of 10,000 tasks entries per policy.
* A policy can contain one or more tasks.
+
Even though a policy can contain more than one task, you cannot configure a policy to contain both file-directory and Storage-Level Access Guard tasks. A policy must contain either all Storage-Level Access Guard tasks or all file-directory tasks.

* Storage-Level Access Guard is used to restrict permissions.
+
It will never give extra access permissions.

When adding tasks to security policies, you must specify the following four required parameters:

* SVM name
* Policy name
* Path
* Security descriptor to associate with the path

You can customize the security descriptor configuration by using the following optional parameters:

* Security type
* Propagation mode
* Index position
* Access control type

The value for any optional parameter is ignored for Storage-Level Access Guard.

.Steps

. Add a task with an associated security descriptor to the security policy: `vserver security file-directory policy task add -vserver vserver_name -policy-name policy_name -path path -ntfs-sd SD_nameoptional_parameters`
+
`file-directory` is the default value for the `-access-control` parameter. Specifying the access control type when configuring file and directory access tasks is optional.
+
`vserver security file-directory policy task add -vserver vs1 -policy-name policy1 -path /home/dir1 -security-type ntfs -ntfs-mode propagate -ntfs-sd sd2 -index-num 1 -access-control file-directory`

. Verify the policy task configuration: `vserver security file-directory policy task show -vserver vserver_name -policy-name policy_name -path path`
+
`vserver security file-directory policy task show`
+
