If you want to use IPv6 on your CIFS server, you need to be aware of how ONTAP supports IPv6 for SMB access and network communication for CIFS services.

== Windows client and server support

ONTAP provides support for Windows servers and clients that support IPv6. The following describes Microsoft Windows client and server IPv6 support:


* Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2012 and later support IPv6 for both SMB file sharing and Active Directory services, including DNS, LDAP, CLDAP, and Kerberos services.
+
If IPv6 addresses are configured, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 and later releases use IPv6 by default for Active Directory services. Both NTLM and Kerberos authentication over IPv6 connections are supported.
+
All Windows clients supported by ONTAP can connect to SMB shares by using IPv6 addresses.

For the latest information about which Windows clients ONTAP supports, see the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix[Interoperability Matrix^].

[NOTE]
====
NT domains are not supported for IPv6.
