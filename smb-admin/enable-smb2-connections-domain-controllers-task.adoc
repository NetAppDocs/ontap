[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.1, you can enable SMB version 2.0 to connect to a domain controller. Doing so is necessary if you have disabled SMB 1.0 on domain controllers. Beginning with ONTAP 9.2, SMB2 is enabled by default.

.About this task

The `smb2-enabled-for-dc-connections` command option enables the system default for the release of ONTAP you are using. The system default for ONTAP 9.1 is enabled for SMB 1.0 and disabled for SMB 2.0. The system default for ONTAP 9.2 is enabled for SMB 1.0 and enabled for SMB 2.0. If the domain controller cannot negotiate SMB 2.0 initially, it uses SMB 1.0.

SMB 1.0 can be disabled from ONTAP to a domain controller. In ONTAP 9.1, if SMB 1.0 has been disabled, SMB 2.0 must be enabled in order to communicate with a domain controller.

* link:supported-versions-functionality-concept.html[Supported SMB versions and functionality].

[NOTE]
====
If `-smb1-enabled-for-dc-connections` is set to `false` while `-smb1-enabled` is set to `true`, ONTAP denies SMB 1.0 connections as the client, but continues to accept inbound SMB 1.0 connections as the server. 
====

.Steps

. Before changing SMB security settings, verify which SMB versions are enabled: `vserver cifs security show`
. Scroll down the list to see the SMB versions.
. Perform the appropriate command, using the `smb2-enabled-for-dc-connections` option.
