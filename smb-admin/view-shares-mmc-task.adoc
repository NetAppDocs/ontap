You can view information about SMB shares on your SVM and perform some management tasks using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC). Before you can view the shares, you need to connect the MMC to the SVM.

.About this task

You can perform the following tasks on shares contained within SVMs using the MMC:

* View shares
* View active sessions
* View open files
* Enumerate the list of sessions, files and tree connections in the system
* Close open files in the system
* Close open sessions
* Create/manage shares

[NOTE]
====
The views displayed by the preceding capabilities are node specific and not cluster specific. Therefore, when you use the MMC to connect to the SMB server host name (that is, cifs01.domain.local), you are routed, based on how you have set up DNS, to a single LIF within your cluster.
====

The following functions are not supported in MMC for ONTAP:

* Creating new local users/groups
* Managing/viewing existing local users/groups
* Viewing events or performance logs
* Storage
* Services and applications

In instances where the operation is not supported, you might experience `remote procedure call failed` errors.
