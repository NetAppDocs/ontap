summary: "Even though IPv6 is enabled on the cluster using a network option, you cannot disable IPv6 for SMB by using the same command. Instead, ONTAP disables IPv6 when the cluster administrator disables the last IPv6-enabled interface on the cluster. You should communicate with the cluster administrator about management of your IPv6 enabled interfaces."

Even though IPv6 is enabled on the cluster using a network option, you cannot disable IPv6 for SMB by using the same command. Instead, ONTAP disables IPv6 when the cluster administrator disables the last IPv6-enabled interface on the cluster. You should communicate with the cluster administrator about management of your IPv6 enabled interfaces.

For more information about disabling IPv6 on the cluster, see the _Network Management Guide_.
