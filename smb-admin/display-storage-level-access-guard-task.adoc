[.lead]
Storage-Level Access Guard is a third layer of security applied on a volume or qtree. Storage-Level Access Guard settings cannot be viewed by using the Windows Properties window. You must use the ONTAP CLI to view information about Storage-Level Access Guard security, which you can use to validate your configuration or to troubleshoot file access issues.

.About this task

You must supply the name of the storage virtual machine (SVM) and the path to the volume or qtree whose Storage-Level Access Guard security information you want to display. You can display the output in summary form or as a detailed list.

.Step

. Display Storage-Level Access Guard security settings with the desired level of detail:
+
[options="header"]
|===
| If you want to display information...| Enter the following command...
a|
In summary form
a|
`vserver security file-directory show -vserver _vserver_name_ -path _path_`
a|
With expanded detail
a|
`vserver security file-directory show -vserver _vserver_name_ -path _path_ -expand-mask true`
|===

.Examples

The following example displays Storage-Level Access Guard security information for the NTFS security-style volume with the path `/datavol1` in SVM vs1:
