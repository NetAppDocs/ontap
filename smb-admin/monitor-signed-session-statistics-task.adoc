You can monitor SMB sessions statistics and determine which established sessions are signed and which are not.

.About this task

The `statistics` command at the advanced privilege level provides the `signed_sessions` counter that you can use to monitor the number of signed SMB sessions. The `signed_sessions` counter is available with the following statistics objects:

* `cifs` enables you to monitor SMB signing for all SMB sessions.
* `smb1` enables you to monitor SMB signing for SMB 1.0 sessions.
* `smb2` enables you to monitor SMB signing for SMB 2.x and SMB 3.0 sessions.
+
SMB 3.0 statistics are included in the output for the `smb2` object.

If you want to compare the number of signed session to the total number of sessions, you can compare output for the `signed_sessions` counter with the output for the `established_sessions` counter.

You must start a statistics sample collection before you can view the resultant data. You can view data from the sample if you do not stop data collection. Stopping data collection gives you a fixed sample. Not stopping data collection gives you the ability to get updated data that you can use to compare against previous queries. The comparison can help you identify trends.

.Steps

. Set the privilege level to advanced: +
`set -privilege advanced`
. Start a data collection: +
 `statistics start -object {cifs|smb1|smb2} -instance instance -sample-id _sample_ID_ [-node _node_name_]`
+
If you do not specify the `-sample-id` parameter, the command generates a sample identifier for you and defines this sample as the default sample for the CLI session. The value for `-sample-id` is a text string. If you run this command during the same CLI session and do not specify the `-sample-id` parameter, the command overwrites the previous default sample.
+
You can optionally specify the node on which you want to collect statistics. If you do not specify the node, the sample collects statistics for all nodes in the cluster.
+

. Use the `statistics stop` command to stop collecting data for the sample.
+
Learn more about `statistics stop` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/statistics-stop.html[ONTAP command reference^].
. View SMB signing statistics:
+
[options="header"]
|===
| If you want to view information for...| Enter...
a|
Signed sessions
a|
`show -sample-id sample_ID -counter signed_sessions\|_node_name_ [-node _node_name_]`
a|
Signed sessions and established sessions
a|
`show -sample-id _sample_ID_ -counter signed_sessions\|established_sessions\|_node_name_ [-node node_name]`
|===
If you want to display information for only a single node, specify the optional `-node` parameter.
+

. Return to the admin privilege level: +
`set -privilege admin`

The following example shows how you can monitor SMB 2.x and SMB 3.0 signing statistics on storage virtual machine (SVM) vs1.

The following command moves to the advanced privilege level:

----
cluster1::> set -privilege advanced

Warning: These advanced commands are potentially dangerous; use them only when directed to do so by support personnel.

----

The following command starts data collection for a new sample:

----
cluster1::*> statistics start -object smb2 -sample-id smbsigning_sample -vserver vs1
Statistics collection is being started for Sample-id: smbsigning_sample
----

The following command stops the data collection for the sample:

----
cluster1::*> statistics stop -sample-id smbsigning_sample
Statistics collection is being stopped for Sample-id: smbsigning_sample
----

The following command shows signed SMB sessions and established SMB sessions by node from the sample:

----
cluster1::*> statistics show -sample-id smbsigning_sample -counter signed_sessions|established_sessions|node_name
