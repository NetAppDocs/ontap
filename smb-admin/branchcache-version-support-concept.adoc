You should be aware of which BranchCache versions ONTAP supports.

ONTAP supports BranchCache 1 and the enhanced BranchCache 2:

* When you configure BranchCache on the SMB server for the storage virtual machine (SVM), you can enable BranchCache 1, BranchCache 2, or all versions.
+
By default, all versions are enabled.

* If you enable only BranchCache 2, the remote office Windows client machines must support BranchCache 2.
+
Only SMB 3.0 or later clients support BranchCache 2.

For more information about BranchCache versions, see the Microsoft TechNet Library.
