You can monitor SMB encryption statistics and determine which established sessions and share connections are encrypted and which are not.

.About this task

The `statistics` command at the advanced privilege level provides the following counters, which you can use to monitor the number of encrypted SMB sessions and share connections:

[options="header"]
|===
| Counter name| Descriptions
a|
`encrypted_sessions`
a|
Gives the number of encrypted SMB 3.0 sessions
a|
`encrypted_share_connections`
a|
Gives the number of encrypted shares on which a tree connect has happened
a|
`rejected_unencrypted_sessions`
a|
Gives the number of session setups rejected due to a lack of client encryption capability
a|
`rejected_unencrypted_shares`
a|
Gives the number of share mappings rejected due to a lack of client encryption capability
|===
These counters are available with the following statistics objects:

* `cifs` enables you to monitor SMB encryption for all SMB 3.0 sessions.
+
SMB 3.0 statistics are included in the output for the `cifs` object.    If you want to compare the number of encrypted sessions to the total number of sessions, you can compare output for the `encrypted_sessions` counter with the output for the `established_sessions` counter.
+
If you want to compare the number of encrypted share connections to the total number of share connections, you can compare output for the `encrypted_share_connections` counter with the output for the `connected_shares` counter.

* `rejected_unencrypted_sessions` provides the number of times an attempt has been made to establish an SMB session that requires encryption from a client that does not support SMB encryption.
* `rejected_unencrypted_shares` provides the number of times an attempt has been made to connect to an SMB share that requires encryption from a client that does not support SMB encryption.

You must start a statistics sample collection before you can view the resultant data. You can view data from the sample if you do not stop the data collection. Stopping data collection gives you a fixed sample. Not stopping data collection gives you the ability to get updated data that you can use to compare against previous queries. The comparison can help you identify trends.

.Steps

. Set the privilege level to advanced: +
`set -privilege advanced`
. Start a data collection: +
 `statistics start -object {cifs|smb1|smb2} -instance _instance_ -sample-id _sample_ID_ [-node _node_name_]`
+
If you do not specify the `-sample-id` parameter, the command generates a sample identifier for you and defines this sample as the default sample for the CLI session. The value for `-sample-id` is a text string. If you run this command during the same CLI session and do not specify the `-sample-id` parameter, the command overwrites the previous default sample.
+
You can optionally specify the node on which you want to collect statistics. If you do not specify the node, the sample collects statistics for all nodes in the cluster.
+

. Use the `statistics stop` command to stop collecting data for the sample.
+
Learn more about `statistics stop` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/statistics-stop.html[ONTAP command reference^].
. View SMB encryption statistics:
+
[options="header"]
|===
| If you want to view information for...| Enter...
a|
Encrypted sessions
a|
`show -sample-id _sample_ID_ -counter encrypted_sessions\|_node_name_ [-node _node_name_]`
a|
Encrypted sessions and established sessions
a|
`show -sample-id _sample_ID_ -counter encrypted_sessions\|established_sessions\|_node_name_ [-node _node_name_]`
a|
Encrypted share connections
a|
`show -sample-id _sample_ID_ -counter encrypted_share_connections\|_node_name_ [-node _node_name_]`
a|
Encrypted share connections and connected shares
a|
`show -sample-id _sample_ID_ -counter encrypted_share_connections\|connected_shares\|_node_name_ [-node _node_name_]`
a|
Rejected unencrypted sessions
a|
`show -sample-id _sample_ID_ -counter rejected_unencrypted_sessions\|_node_name_ [-node _node_name_]`
a|
Rejected unencrypted share connections
a|
`show -sample-id _sample_ID_ -counter rejected_unencrypted_share\|_node_name_ [-node _node_name_]`
|===
If you want to display information only for a single node, specify the optional `-node` parameter.
+

The following example shows how you can monitor SMB 3.0 encryption statistics on storage virtual machine (SVM) vs1.

The following command moves to the advanced privilege level:

----
cluster1::> set -privilege advanced

Warning: These advanced commands are potentially dangerous; use them only when directed to do so by support personnel.
Do you want to continue? {y|n}: y
----

The following command starts data collection for a new sample:

----
cluster1::*> statistics start -object cifs -sample-id smbencryption_sample -vserver vs1
Statistics collection is being started for Sample-id: smbencryption_sample
----

The following command stops data collection for that sample:

----
cluster1::*> statistics stop -sample-id smbencryption_sample
Statistics collection is being stopped for Sample-id: smbencryption_sample
----

The following command shows encrypted SMB sessions and established SMB sessions by the node from the sample:

----
cluster2::*> statistics show -object cifs -counter established_sessions|encrypted_sessions|node_name –node node_name

Object: cifs
Instance: [proto_ctx:003]
