When SMB sessions use SMB encryption, all SMB communications to and from Windows clients experience a performance impact, which affects both the clients and the server (that is, the nodes on the cluster running the SVM that contains the SMB server).

The performance impact shows as increased CPU usage on both the clients and the server, although the amount of network traffic does not change.

The extent of the performance impact depends on the version of ONTAP 9 you are running. Beginning with ONTAP 9.7, a new encryption off-load algorithm can enable better performance in encrypted SMB traffic. SMB encryption offload is enabled by default when SMB encryption is enabled.

Enhanced SMB encryption performance requires AES-NI offload capability. See the Hardware Universe (HWU) to verify that AES-NI offload is supported for your platform.

Further performance improvements are also possible if you are able to use SMB version 3.11 which supports the much faster GCM algorithm.

Depending on your network, ONTAP 9 version, SMB version, and SVM implementation, the performance impact of SMB encryption can vary widely; you can verify it only through testing in your network environment.

SMB encryption is disabled by default on the SMB server. You should enable SMB encryption only on those SMB shares or SMB servers that require encryption. With SMB encryption, ONTAP performs additional processing of decrypting the requests and encrypting the responses for every request. SMB encryption should therefore be enabled only when necessary.
