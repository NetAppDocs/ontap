[.lead]
You can join a storage virtual machine (SVM) to an Active Directory domain without deleting the existing SMB server by modifying the domain using the `vserver cifs modify` command. You can rejoin the current domain or join a new one.

.Before you begin

* The SVM must already have a DNS configuration.
* The DNS configuration for the SVM must be able to serve the target domain.
+
The DNS servers must contain the service location records (SRV) for the domain LDAP and domain controller servers.

.About this task

* The administrative status of the CIFS server must be set to `down` to proceed with Active Directory domain modification.
* If the command completes successfully, the administrative status is automatically set to `up`. Learn more about `up` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/up.html[ONTAP command reference^].
* When joining a domain, this command might take several minutes to complete.

.Steps

. Join the SVM to the CIFS server domain: `vserver cifs modify -vserver _vserver_name_ -domain _domain_name_ -status-admin down`
+
Learn more about `vserver cifs modify` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/vserver-cifs-modify.html[ONTAP command reference^].
If you need to reconfigure DNS for the new domain, learn more about `vserver dns modify` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/search.html?q=vserver+dns+modify[ONTAP command reference^].
+
In order to create an Active Directory machine account for the SMB server, you must supply the name and password of a Windows account with sufficient privileges to add computers to the `ou= _example_ ou` container within the `_example_`.com domain.
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.7, your AD administrator can provide you with a URI to a keytab file as an alternative to providing you with a name and password to a privileged Windows account. When you receive the URI, include it in the `-keytab-uri` parameter with the `vserver cifs` commands.

. Verify that the CIFS server is in the desired Active Directory domain: `vserver cifs show`

.Example

In the following example, the SMB server "`CIFSSERVER1`" on SVM vs1 joins the example.com domain using keytab authentication:

----

cluster1::> vserver cifs modify -vserver vs1 -domain example.com -status-admin down -keytab-uri http://admin.example.com/ontap1.keytab

cluster1::> vserver cifs show

          Server       Status       Domain/Workgroup  Authentication
Vserver   Name         Admin        Name              Style
--------- -----------  ---------    ----------------  --------------
vs1       CIFSSERVER1  up           EXAMPLE          domain
