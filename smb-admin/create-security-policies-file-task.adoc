Creating a file security policy for SVMs is the third step in configuring and applying ACLs to a file or folder. A policy acts as a container for various tasks, where each task is a single entry that can be applied to files or folders. You can add tasks to the security policy later.

.About this task

The tasks that you add to a security policy contain associations between the NTFS security descriptor and the file or folder paths. Therefore, you should associate the security policy with each SVM (containing NTFS security-style volumes or mixed security-style volumes).

.Steps

. Create a security policy: `vserver security file-directory policy create -vserver vserver_name -policy-name policy_name`
+
`vserver security file-directory policy create -policy-name policy1 -vserver vs1`

. Verify the security policy: `vserver security file-directory policy show`
+
