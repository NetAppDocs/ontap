You can display BranchCache statistics to, among other things, identify how well caching is performing, determine whether your configuration is providing cached content to clients, and determine whether hash files were deleted to make room for more recent hash data.

.About this task

The `hashd` statistic object contains counters that provide statistical information about BranchCache hashes. The `cifs` statistic object contains counters that provide statistical information about BranchCache-related activity. You can collect and display information about these objects at the advanced-privilege level.

.Steps

. Set the privilege level to advanced: `set -privilege advanced`
+
----
cluster1::> set -privilege advanced

Warning: These advanced commands are potentially dangerous; use them only when directed to do so by support personnel.

----

. Display the BranchCache-related counters by using the `statistics catalog counter show` command.

cluster1::*> statistics catalog counter show -object hashd

Object: hashd
    Counter                     Description
    --------------------------- ----------------------------------------------
    branchcache_hash_created    Number of times a request to generate
                                BranchCache hash for a file succeeded.
    branchcache_hash_files_replaced
                                Number of times a BranchCache hash file was
                                deleted to make room for more recent hash
                                data. This happens if the hash store size is
                                exceeded.
    branchcache_hash_rejected   Number of times a request to generate
                                BranchCache hash data failed.
    branchcache_hash_store_bytes
                                Total number of bytes used to store hash data.
    branchcache_hash_store_size Total space used to store BranchCache hash
                                data for the Vserver.
    instance_name               Instance Name
    instance_uuid               Instance UUID
    node_name                   System node name
    node_uuid                   System node id

cluster1::*> statistics catalog counter show -object cifs

Object: cifs
    Counter                     Description
    --------------------------- ----------------------------------------------
    active_searches             Number of active searches over SMB and SMB2
    auth_reject_too_many        Authentication refused after too many
                                requests were made in rapid succession
    avg_directory_depth         Average number of directories crossed by SMB
                                and SMB2 path-based commands
    avg_junction_depth          Average number of junctions crossed by SMB
                                and SMB2 path-based commands
    branchcache_hash_fetch_fail Total number of times a request to fetch hash
                                data failed. These are failures when
                                attempting to read existing hash data. It
                                does not include attempts to fetch hash data
                                that has not yet been generated.
    branchcache_hash_fetch_ok   Total number of times a request to fetch hash
                                data succeeded.
    branchcache_hash_sent_bytes Total number of bytes sent to clients
                                requesting hashes.
    branchcache_missing_hash_bytes
                                Total number of bytes of data that had to be
                                read by the client because the hash for that
                                content was not available on the server.
