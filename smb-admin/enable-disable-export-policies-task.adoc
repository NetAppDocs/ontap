You can enable or disable export policies for SMB access on storage virtual machines (SVMs). Using export policies to control SMB access to resources is optional.

.Before you begin

The following are the requirements for enabling export policies for SMB:

* The client must have a "PTR" record in DNS before you create the export rules for that client.
* An additional set of "A" and "PTR" records for host names is required if the SVM provides access to NFS clients and the host name you want to use for NFS access is different from the CIFS server name.

.About this task

When setting up a new CIFS server on your SVM, the use of export policies for SMB access is disabled by default. You can enable export policies for SMB access if you want to control access based on authentication protocol or on client IP addresses or host names. You can enable or disable export policies for SMB access at any time.

NOTE: Enabling export policies for CIFS/SMB in an NFS-enabled SVM allows a Linux client to use the `showmount -e` command on the SVM to view the junction paths of all SMB volumes with associated export policy rules.

.Steps

. Set the privilege level to advanced: `set -privilege advanced`
. Enable or disable export policies:
 ** Enable export policies: `vserver cifs options modify -vserver _vserver_name_ -is-exportpolicy-enabled true`
 ** Disable export policies: `vserver cifs options modify -vserver _vserver_name_ -is-exportpolicy-enabled false`
. Return to the admin privilege level: `set -privilege admin`

.Example

The following example enables the use of export policies to control SMB client access to resources on SVM vs1:

----
cluster1::> set -privilege advanced
Warning: These advanced commands are potentially dangerous; use them
only when directed to do so by technical support personnel.
Do you wish to continue? (y or n): y

cluster1::*> vserver cifs options modify -vserver vs1 -is-exportpolicy-enabled true

cluster1::*> set -privilege admin
