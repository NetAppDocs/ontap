Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can specify that connections to domain controllers be encrypted.

.About this task

ONTAP requires encryption for domain controller (DC) communications when the `-encryption-required-for-dc-connection` option is set to `true`; the default is `false`. When the option is set, only the SMB3 protocol will be used for ONTAP-DC connections, because encryption is only supported by SMB3.

When encrypted DC communications are required, the `-smb2-enabled-for-dc-connections` option is ignored, because ONTAP only negotiates SMB3 connections. If a DC doesn't support SMB3 and encryption, ONTAP will not connect with it.

.Step

. Enable encrypted communication with the DC: `vserver cifs security modify -vserver _svm_name_ -encryption-required-for-dc-connection true`
