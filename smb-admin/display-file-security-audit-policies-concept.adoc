You can display information about file security on files and directories contained within volumes on storage virtual machines (SVMs). You can display information about audit policies on FlexVol volumes. If configured, you can display information about Storage-Level Access Guard and Dynamic Access Control security settings on FlexVol volumes.

== Displaying information about file security

You can display information about file security applied to data contained within volumes and qtrees (for FlexVol volumes) with the following security styles:

* NTFS
* UNIX
* Mixed

== Displaying information about audit policies

You can display information about audit policies for auditing access events on FlexVol volumes over the following NAS protocols:

* SMB (all versions)
* NFSv4.x

== Displaying information about Storage-Level Access Guard (SLAG) security

Storage-Level Access Guard security can be applied on FlexVol volumes and qtree objects with the following security styles:

* NTFS
* Mixed
* UNIX (if a CIFS server is configured on the SVM that contains the volume)

== Displaying information about Dynamic Access Control (DAC) security

Dynamic Access Control security can be applied on an object within a FlexVol volume with the following security styles:

* NTFS
* Mixed (if the object has NTFS effective security)
