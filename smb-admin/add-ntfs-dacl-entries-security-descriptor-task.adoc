[.lead]
Adding DACL (discretionary access control list) access control entries (ACEs) to the NTFS security descriptor is the second step in configuring and applying NTFS ACLs to a file or folder. Each entry identifies which object is allowed or denied access, and defines what the object can or cannot do to the files or folders defined in the ACE.

.About this task

You can add one or more ACEs to the security descriptor's DACL.

If the security descriptor contains a DACL that has existing ACEs, the command adds the new ACE to the DACL. If the security descriptor does not contain a DACL, the command creates the DACL and adds the new ACE to it.

You can optionally customize DACL entries by specifying what rights you want to allow or deny for the account specified in the `-account` parameter. There are three mutually exclusive methods for specifying rights:

* Rights
* Advanced rights
* Raw rights (advanced-privilege)

[NOTE]
====
If you do not specify rights for the DACL entry, the default is to set the rights to `Full Control`.
====

You can optionally customize DACL entries by specifying how to apply inheritance.

The value for any optional parameter is ignored for Storage-Level Access Guard.

.Steps

. Add a DACL entry to a security descriptor: `vserver security file-directory ntfs dacl add -vserver vserver_name -ntfs-sd SD_name -access-type {allow|deny} -account name_or_SIDoptional_parameters`
+
`vserver security file-directory ntfs dacl add -ntfs-sd sd1 -access-type deny -account domain\joe -rights full-control -apply-to this-folder -vserver vs1`

. Verify that the DACL entry is correct: `vserver security file-directory ntfs dacl show -vserver vserver_name -ntfs-sd SD_name -access-type {allow|deny} -account name_or_SID`
+
`vserver security file-directory ntfs dacl show -vserver vs1 -ntfs-sd sd1 -access-type deny -account domain\joe`
