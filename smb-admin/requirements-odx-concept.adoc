[.lead]
Before you can use ODX for copy offloads with your storage virtual machine (SVM), you need to be aware of certain requirements.

== ONTAP version requirements

ONTAP releases support ODX for copy offloads.

== SMB version requirements

* ONTAP supports ODX with SMB 3.0 and later.
* SMB 3.0 must be enabled on the CIFS server before ODX can be enabled:
 ** Enabling ODX also enables SMB 3.0, if it is not already enabled.
 ** Disabling SMB 3.0 also disables ODX.

== Windows server and client requirements

Before you can use ODX for copy offloads, the Windows client must support the feature. 

The link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix[NetApp Interoperability Matrix^]contains the latest information about supported Windows clients.


== Volume requirements

* Source volumes must be a minimum of 1.25 GB.
* If you use compressed volumes, the compression type must be adaptive and only compression group size 8K is supported.
+
Secondary compression type is not supported.
