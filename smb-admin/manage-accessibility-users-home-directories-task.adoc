By default, a user's home directory can be accessed only by that user. For shares where the dynamic name of the share is preceded with a tilde ({tilde}), you can enable or disable access to users' home directories by Windows administrators or by any other user (public access).

.Before you begin

Home directory shares on the storage virtual machine (SVM) must be configured with dynamic share names that are preceded with a tilde ({tilde}). The following cases illustrate share naming requirements:

[options="header"]
|===
| Home directory share name| Example of command to connect to the share
a|
{tilde}%d{tilde}%w
a|
`net use * {backslash}{backslash}IPaddress{backslash}{tilde}domain{tilde}user/u:credentials`
a|
{tilde}%w
a|
`net use * {backslash}{backslash}IPaddress{backslash}{tilde}user/u:credentials`
a|
{tilde}abc{tilde}%w
a|
`net use * {backslash}{backslash}IPaddress{backslash}abc{tilde}user/u:credentials`
|===

.Step

. Perform the appropriate action:
+
[options="header"]
|===
| If you want to enable or disable access to users' home directories to...| Enter the following...
| Windows administrators
| `vserver cifs home-directory modify -vserver _vserver_name_ -is-home-dirs-access-for-admin-enabled {true{vbar}false}`
The default is `true`.
| Any user (public access)
a|
    .. Set the privilege level to advanced: +
    `set -privilege advanced`
 
    .. Enable or disable access: `vserver cifs home-directory modify -vserver _vserver_name_ -is-home-dirs-access-for-public-enabled {true{vbar}false}` +
    The default is `false`.
 
    .. Return to the admin privilege level: +
    `set -privilege admin`
|===

The following example enables public access to users' home directories: +
`set -privilege advanced` +
`vserver cifs home-directory modify -vserver vs1 -is-home-dirs-access-for-public-enabled true` +
`set -privilege admin`
