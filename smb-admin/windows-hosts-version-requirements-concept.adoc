ONTAP and branch office Windows hosts must meet certain version requirements before you can configure BranchCache.

Before configuring BranchCache, you must ensure that the version of ONTAP on the cluster and participating branch office clients support SMB 2.1 or later and support the BranchCache feature. If you configure Hosted Cache mode, you must also ensure that you use a supported host for the cache server.

BranchCache 1 is supported on the following ONTAP versions and Windows hosts:

* Content server: storage virtual machine (SVM) with ONTAP
* Cache server: Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows Server 2012 or later
* Peer or client: Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8, Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows Server 2012 or later

BranchCache 2 is supported on the following ONTAP versions and Windows hosts:

* Content server: SVM with ONTAP
* Cache server: Windows Server 2012 or later
* Peer or client: Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012 or later
