Before users and applications can access data on the CIFS server over SMB, you must create and configure SMB shares, which is a named access point in a volume. You can customize shares by specifying share parameters and share properties. You can modify an existing share at any time.

When you create an SMB share, ONTAP creates a default ACL for the share with Full Control permissions for Everyone.

SMB shares are tied to the CIFS server on the storage virtual machine (SVM). SMB shares are deleted if either the SVM is deleted or the CIFS server with which it is associated is deleted from the SVM. If you recreate the CIFS server on the SVM, you must re-create the SMB shares.
