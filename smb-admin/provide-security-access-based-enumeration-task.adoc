When access-based enumeration (ABE) is enabled on an SMB share, users who do not have permission to access a folder or file contained within the share (whether through individual or group permission restrictions) do not see that shared resource displayed in their environment, although the share itself remains visible.

Conventional share properties allow you to specify which users (individually or in groups) have permission to view or modify files or folders contained within the share. However, they do not allow you to control whether folders or files within the share are visible to users who do not have permission to access them. This could pose problems if the names of these folders or files within the share describe sensitive information, such as the names of customers or products under development.

Access-based enumeration (ABE) extends share properties to include the enumeration of files and folders within the share. ABE therefore enables you to filter the display of files and folders within the share based on user access rights. That is, the share itself would be visible to all users, but files and folders within the share could be displayed to or hidden from designated users. In addition to protecting sensitive information in your workplace, ABE enables you to simplify the display of large directory structures for the benefit of users who do not need access to your full range of content. For example, the share itself would be visible to all users, but files and folders within the share could be displayed or hidden.
