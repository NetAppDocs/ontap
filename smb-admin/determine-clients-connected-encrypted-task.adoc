[.lead]
You can display information about connected SMB sessions to determine whether clients are using encrypted SMB connections. This can be helpful in determining whether SMB client sessions are connecting with the desired security settings.

.About this task

SMB clients sessions can have one of three encryption levels:

* `unencrypted`
+
The SMB session is not encrypted. Neither storage virtual machine (SVM)-level or share-level encryption is configured.

* `partially-encrypted`
+
Encryption is initiated when the tree-connect occurs. Share-level encryption is configured. SVM-level encryption is not enabled.

* `encrypted`
+
The SMB session is fully encrypted. SVM-level encryption is enabled. Share level encryption might or might not be enabled. The SVM-level encryption setting supersedes the share-level encryption setting.

.Steps

. Perform one of the following actions:

|===
| If you want display information about...| Enter the command...
a|
Sessions with a specified encryption setting for sessions on a specified SVM
a|
`vserver cifs session show -vserver _vserver_name_ {unencrypted\|partially-encrypted\|encrypted} -instance`
a|
The encryption setting for a specific session ID on a specified SVM
a|
`vserver cifs session show -vserver _vserver_name_ -session-id _integer_ -instance`
|===

.Examples

The following command displays detailed session information, including the encryption setting, on an SMB session with a session ID of 2:
