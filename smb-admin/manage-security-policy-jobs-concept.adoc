If a security policy job exists, under certain circumstances, you cannot modify that security policy or the tasks assigned to that policy. You should understand under what conditions you can or cannot modify security policies so that any attempts that you make to modify the policy are successful. Modifications to the policy include adding, removing, or modifying tasks assigned to the policy and deleting or modifying the policy.

You cannot modify a security policy or a task assigned to that policy if a job exists for that policy and that job is in the following states:

* The job is running or in progress.
* The job is paused.
* The job is resumed and is in the running state.
* If the job is waiting to failover to another node.

Under the following circumstances, if a job exists for a security policy, you can successfully modify that security policy or a task assigned to that policy:

* The policy job is stopped.
* The policy job has successfully finished.
