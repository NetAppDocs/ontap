ONTAP supports Microsoft folder redirection, which enables users or administrators to redirect the path of a local folder to a location on the CIFS server. It appears as if redirected folders are stored on the local Windows client, even though the data is stored on an SMB share.

Folder redirection is intended mostly for organizations that have already deployed home directories, and that want to maintain compatibility with their existing home directory environment.

* `Documents`, `Desktop`, and `Start Menu` are examples of folders that you can redirect.
* Users can redirect folders from their Windows client.
* Administrators can centrally configure and manage folder redirection by configuring GPOs in Active Directory.
* If administrators have configured roaming profiles, folder redirection enables administrators to divide user data from profile data.
* Administrators can use folder redirection and offline files together to redirect data storage for local folders to the CIFS server, while allowing users to cache the content locally.
