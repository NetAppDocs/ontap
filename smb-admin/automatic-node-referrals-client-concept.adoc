To determine what referrals are made from the client's perspective, you can use the Windows `dfsutil.exe` utility.

The Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) kit available with Windows 7 and later clients contains the `dfsutil.exe` utility. Using this utility, you can display information about the contents of the referral cache as well as view information about each referral that the client is currently using. You can also use the utility to clear the client's referral cache. For more information, consult the Microsoft TechNet Library.
