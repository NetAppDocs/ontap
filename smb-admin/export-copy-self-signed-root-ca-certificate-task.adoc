To use LDAP over SSL/TLS for securing Active Directory communication, you must first export a copy of the Active Directory Certificate Service's self-signed root CA certificate to a certificate file and convert it to an ASCII text file. This text file is used by ONTAP to install the certificate on the storage virtual machine (SVM).

.Before you begin

The Active Directory Certificate Service must already be installed and configured for the domain to which the CIFS server belongs. You can find information about installing and configuring Active Director Certificate Services by consulting the Microsoft TechNet Library.
