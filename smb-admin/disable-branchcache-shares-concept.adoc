summary: "If you do not want to provide BranchCache caching services on certain SMB shares but you might want to provide caching services on those shares later, you can disable BranchCache on a share-by-share basis. If you have BranchCache configured to offer caching on all shares but you want to temporarily disable all caching services, you can modify the BranchCache configuration to stop automatic caching on all shares."

If you do not want to provide BranchCache caching services on certain SMB shares but you might want to provide caching services on those shares later, you can disable BranchCache on a share-by-share basis. If you have BranchCache configured to offer caching on all shares but you want to temporarily disable all caching services, you can modify the BranchCache configuration to stop automatic caching on all shares.

If BranchCache on an SMB share is subsequently disabled after first being enabled, ONTAP stops sending metadata to the requesting client. A client that needs data retrieves it directly from the content server (CIFS server on the storage virtual machine (SVM)).
