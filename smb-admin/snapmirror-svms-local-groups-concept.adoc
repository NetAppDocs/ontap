You should be aware of the guidelines when you configure SnapMirror on volumes owned by SVMs that contain local groups.

You cannot use local groups in ACEs applied to files, directories, or shares that are replicated by SnapMirror to another SVM. If you use the SnapMirror feature to create a DR mirror to a volume on another SVM and the volume has an ACE for a local group, the ACE is not valid on the mirror. If data is replicated to a different SVM, the data is effectively crossing into a different local domain. The permissions granted to local users and groups are valid only within the scope of the SVM on which they were originally created.
