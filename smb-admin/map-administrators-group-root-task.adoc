summary: "If you have only CIFS clients in your environment and your storage virtual machine (SVM) was set up as a multiprotocol storage system, you must have at least one Windows account that has root privilege for accessing files on the SVM; otherwise, you cannot manage the SVM because you do not have sufficient user rights."

[.lead]
If you have only CIFS clients in your environment and your storage virtual machine (SVM) was set up as a multiprotocol storage system, you must have at least one Windows account that has root privilege for accessing files on the SVM; otherwise, you cannot manage the SVM because you do not have sufficient user rights.

.About this task

If your storage system was set up as NTFS-only, the `/etc` directory has a file-level ACL that enables the administrators group to access the ONTAP configuration files.

.Steps

. Set the privilege level to advanced: `set -privilege advanced`
. Configure the CIFS server option that maps the administrators group to root as appropriate:
+
[options="header"]
|===
| If you want to...| Then...
a|
Map the administrator group members to root
a|
`vserver cifs options modify -vserver _vserver_name_ -is-admin-users-mapped-to-root-enabled true`     All accounts in the administrators group are considered root, even if you do not have an `/etc/usermap.cfg` entry mapping the accounts to root. If you create a file using an account that belongs to the administrators group, the file is owned by root when you view the file from a UNIX client.
a|
Disable mapping the administrators group members to root
a|
`vserver cifs options modify -vserver _vserver_name_ -is-admin-users-mapped-to-root-enabled false`     Accounts in the administrators group no longer map to root. You can only explicitly map a single user to root.
|===

. Verify that the option is set to the desired value: `vserver cifs options show -vserver _vserver_name_`
. Return to the admin privilege level: `set -privilege admin`
