Because you can apply and manage file and folder security locally without involvement from a remote client, you can significantly reduce the time it takes to set bulk security on a large number of files or folders.

You can benefit from using the CLI to set file and folder security in the following use cases:

* Storage of files in large enterprise environments, such as file storage in home directories
* Migration of data
* Change of Windows domain
* Standardization of file security and audit policies across NTFS file systems
