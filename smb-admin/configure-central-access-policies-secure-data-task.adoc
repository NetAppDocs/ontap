There are several steps that you must take to secure access to data on the CIFS server using central access policies, including enabling Dynamic Access Control (DAC) on the CIFS server, configuring central access policies in Active Directory, applying the central access policies to Active Directory containers with GPOs, and enabling GPOs on the CIFS server.

.Before you begin

* The Active Directory must be configured to use central access policies.
* You must have sufficient access on the Active Directory domain controllers to create central access policies and to create and apply GPOs to the containers that contain the CIFS servers.
* You must have sufficient administrative access on the storage virtual machine (SVM) to execute the necessary commands.

.About this task

Central access policies are defined and applied to group policy objects (GPOs) on Active Directory. You can find information about how to configure central access policies on Active Directory in the Microsoft TechNet Library.

http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh831425.aspx[Microsoft TechNet: Central Access Policy Scenario^]

.Steps

. Enable Dynamic Access Control on the SVM if it is not already enabled by using the `vserver cifs options modify` command.
+
`vserver cifs options modify -vserver vs1 -is-dac-enabled true`

. Enable group policy objects (GPOs) on the CIFS server if they are not already enabled by using the `vserver cifs group-policy modify` command.
+
`vserver cifs group-policy modify -vserver vs1 -status enabled`

. Create central access rules and central access policies on Active Directory.
. Create a group policy object (GPO) to deploy the central access policies on Active Directory.
. Apply the GPO to the container where the CIFS server computer account is located.
. Manually update the GPOs applied to the CIFS server by using the `vserver cifs group-policy update` command.
+
`vserver cifs group-policy update -vserver vs1`

. Verify that the GPO central access policy is applied to the resources on the CIFS server by using the `vserver cifs group-policy show-applied` command.
+
The following example shows that the Default Domain Policy has two central access policies that are applied to the CIFS server:
+
`vserver cifs group-policy show-applied`
