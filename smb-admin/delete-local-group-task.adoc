[.lead]
You can delete a local group from the storage virtual machine (SVM) if it is no longer needed for determining access rights to data associated with that SVM or if it is no longer needed for assigning SVM user rights (privileges) to group members.

.About this task

Keep the following in mind when deleting local groups:

* The file system is not altered.
+
Windows Security Descriptors on files and directories that refer to this group are not adjusted.

* If the group does not exist, an error is returned.
* The special _Everyone_ group cannot be deleted.
* Built-in groups such as _BUILTIN\Administrators_ _BUILTIN\Users_ cannot be deleted.

.Steps

. Determine the name of the local group that you want to delete by displaying the list of local groups on the SVM: `vserver cifs users-and-groups local-group show -vserver vserver_name`
. Delete the local group: `vserver cifs users-and-groups local-group delete -vserver _vserver_name_ â€‘group-name _group_name_`
. Verify that the group is deleted: `vserver cifs users-and-groups local-user show -vserver _vserver_name_`

.Example

The following example deletes the local group "`CIFS_SERVER\sales`" associated with SVM vs1:

----
cluster1::> vserver cifs users-and-groups local-group show -vserver vs1
Vserver   Group Name                   Description
--------- ---------------------------- ----------------------------
vs1       BUILTIN\Administrators       Built-in Administrators group
vs1       BUILTIN\Backup Operators     Backup Operators group
vs1       BUILTIN\Power Users          Restricted administrative privileges
vs1       BUILTIN\Users                All users
vs1       CIFS_SERVER\engineering
vs1       CIFS_SERVER\sales

cluster1::> vserver cifs users-and-groups local-group delete -vserver vs1 -group-name CIFS_SERVER\sales

cluster1::> vserver cifs users-and-groups local-group show -vserver vs1
Vserver   Group Name                   Description
--------- ---------------------------- ----------------------------
vs1       BUILTIN\Administrators       Built-in Administrators group
vs1       BUILTIN\Backup Operators     Backup Operators group
vs1       BUILTIN\Power Users          Restricted administrative privileges
vs1       BUILTIN\Users                All users
vs1       CIFS_SERVER\engineering
