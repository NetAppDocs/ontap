You can display information about the discovered trusted domains for the CIFS server's home domain, which is the domain containing the CIFS server's computer account. This can be useful when you want to know which trusted domains are discovered and how they are ordered within the discovered trusted-domain list.

.About this task

Only the domains with bidirectional trusts with the home domain are discovered. Since the home domain's domain controller (DC) returns the list of trusted domains in an order determined by the DC, the order of the domains within the list cannot be predicted. By displaying the list of trusted domains, you can determine the search order for multidomain name mapping searches.

The displayed trusted domain information is grouped by node and storage virtual machine (SVM).

.Step

. Display information about discovered trusted domains by using the `vserver cifs domain trusts show` command.

`vserver cifs domain trusts show -vserver vs1`
