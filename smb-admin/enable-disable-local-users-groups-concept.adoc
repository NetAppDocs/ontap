Before you can use local users and groups for access control of NTFS security-style data, local user and group functionality must be enabled. Additionally, if you want to use local users for SMB authentication, the local user authentication functionality must be enabled.

Local users and groups functionality and local user authentication are enabled by default. If they are not enabled, you must enable them before you can configure and use local users and groups. You can disable local users and groups functionality at any time.

In addition to explicitly disabling local user and group functionality, ONTAP disables local user and group functionality if any node in the cluster is reverted to an ONTAP release that does not support the functionality. Local user and group functionality is not enabled until all nodes in the cluster are running a version of ONTAP that supports it.
