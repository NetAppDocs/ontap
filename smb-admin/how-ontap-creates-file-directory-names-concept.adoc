ONTAP creates and maintains two names for files or directories in any directory that has access from an SMB client: the original long name and a name in 8.3 format.

For file or directory names that exceed the eight character name or the three character extension limit (for files), ONTAP generates an 8.3-format name as follows:

* It truncates the original file or directory name to six characters, if the name exceeds six characters.
* It appends a tilde (~) and a number, one through five, to file or directory names that are no longer unique after being truncated.
+
If it runs out of numbers because there are more than five similar names, it creates a unique name that bears no relation to the original name.

* In the case of files, it truncates the file name extension to three characters.

For example, if an NFS client creates a file named `specifications.html`, the 8.3 format file name created by ONTAP is `specif~1.htm`. If this name already exists, ONTAP uses a different number at the end of the file name. For example, if an NFS client then creates another file named `specifications_new.html`, the 8.3 format of `specifications_new.html` is `specif~2.htm`.
