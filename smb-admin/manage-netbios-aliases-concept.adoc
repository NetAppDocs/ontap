NetBIOS aliases are alternative names for your SMB server that SMB clients can use when connecting to the SMB server. Configuring NetBIOS aliases for a SMB server can be useful when you are consolidating data from other file servers to the SMB server and want the SMB server to respond to the original file servers' names.

You can specify a list of NetBIOS aliases when you create the SMB server or at any time after you create the SMB server. You can add or remove NetBIOS aliases from the list at any time. You can connect to the SMB server using any of the names in the NetBIOS alias list.
