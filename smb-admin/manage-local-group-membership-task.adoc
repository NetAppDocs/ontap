You can manage local group membership by adding and removing local or domain users, or adding and removing domain groups. This is useful if you want to control access to data based on access controls placed on the group or if you want users to have privileges associated with that group.

.About this task

Guidelines for adding members to a local group:

* You cannot add users to the special _Everyone_ group.
* The local group must exist before you can add a user to it.
* The user must exist before you can add the user to a local group.
* You cannot add a local group to another local group.
* To add a domain user or group to a local group, Data ONTAP must be able to resolve the name to a SID.

Guidelines for removing members from a local group:

* You cannot remove members from the special _Everyone_ group.
* The group from which you want to remove a member must exist.
* ONTAP must be able to resolve the names of members that you want to remove from the group to a corresponding SID.
