Before you configure BranchCache, there are certain recommendations you should keep in mind when deciding on which SMB shares you want to enable BranchCache caching.

You should keep the following recommendations in mind when deciding on which operating mode to use and on which SMB shares to enable BranchCache:

* The benefits of BranchCache are reduced when the data to be remotely cached changes frequently.
* BranchCache services are beneficial for shares containing file content that is reused by multiple remote office clients or by file content that is repeatedly accessed by a single remote user.
* Consider enabling caching for read-only content such as data in snapshots and SnapMirror destinations.
