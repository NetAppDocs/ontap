[.lead]
You can display information about Group Policy Object (GPO) configurations that are defined in Active Directory and about GPO configurations applied to the CIFS server.

.About this task

You can display information about all GPO configurations defined in the Active Directory of the domain to which the CIFS server belongs, or you can display information only about GPO configurations applied to a CIFs server.

.Steps

. Display information about GPO configurations by performing one of the following actions:
+
[options="header"]
|===
| If you want to display information about all Group Policy configurations...| Enter the command...
a|
Defined in Active Directory
a|
`vserver cifs group-policy show-defined -vserver vserver_name`
a|
Applied to a CIFS-enabled storage virtual machine (SVM)
a|
`vserver cifs group-policy show-applied -vserver vserver_name`
|===

.Example

The following example displays the GPO configurations defined in the Active Directory to which the CIFS-enabled SVM named vs1 belongs:
