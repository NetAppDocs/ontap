 ** `Local` when the group policy is configured in ONTAP
 ** `Site` when the group policy is configured at the site level in the domain controller
 ** `Domain` when the group policy is configured at the domain level in the domain controller
 ** `OrganizationalUnit` when the group policy is configured at the Organizational Unit (OU) level in the domain controller
 ** `RSOP` for the resultant set of policies derived from all the group policies defined at various levels

* Restricted group name

.Example

The following example displays information about restricted group GPOs defined in the Active Directory domain to which the CIFS-enabled SVM named vs1 belongs:

----
cluster1::> vserver cifs group-policy restricted-group show-defined -vserver vs1

Vserver: vs1
-------------

     Group Policy Name: gpo1
               Version: 16
                  Link: OrganizationalUnit
            Group Name: group1
               Members: user1
              MemberOf: EXAMPLE\group9

     Group Policy Name: Resultant Set of Policy
               Version: 0
                  Link: RSOP
            Group Name: group1
               Members: user1
              MemberOf: EXAMPLE\group9
