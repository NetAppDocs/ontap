summary: You halt or reboot a node in a two-node cluster without initiating takeover when you perform certain hardware maintenance on a node or a shelf and you want to limit down time by keeping the partner node up, or when there are issues preventing a manual takeover and you want to keep the partner node’s aggregates up and serving data. Additionally, if technical support is assisting you with troubleshooting problems, they might have you perform this procedure as part of those efforts.

You halt or reboot a node in a two-node cluster without initiating takeover when you perform certain hardware maintenance on a node or a shelf and you want to limit down time by keeping the partner node up, or when there are issues preventing a manual takeover and you want to keep the partner node’s aggregates up and serving data. Additionally, if technical support is assisting you with troubleshooting problems, they might have you perform this procedure as part of those efforts.

.About this task
* Before you inhibit takeover (using the `-inhibit-takeover true` parameter), you disable cluster HA.

[CAUTION]
====
* In a two-node cluster, cluster HA ensures that the failure of one node does not disable the cluster. However,  if you do not disable cluster HA before using the  `-inhibit-takeover true` parameter, both nodes stop serving data.

* If you attempt to halt or reboot a node before disabling cluster HA, ONTAP issues a warning and instructs you to disable cluster HA.
====

* You migrate LIFs (logical interfaces) to the partner node that you want to remain online.
* If on the node you are halting or rebooting there are aggregates you want to keep, you move them to the node that you want to remain online.

.Steps
. Verify both nodes are healthy:
`cluster show`
+
For both nodes, `true` appears in the `Health` column.
+
----
cluster::> cluster show
Node         Health  Eligibility
------------ ------- ------------
node1        true     true
node2        true     true
----
+
Learn more about `cluster show` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/cluster-show.html[ONTAP command reference^].


. Migrate all LIFs from the node that you will halt or reboot to the partner node:
`network interface migrate-all -node _node_name_`
+
Learn more about `network interface migrate-all` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/network-interface-migrate-all.html[ONTAP command reference^].

. If on the node you will halt or reboot there are aggregates you want to keep online when the node is down, relocate them to the partner node; otherwise, go to the next step.

.. Show the aggregates on the node you will halt or reboot:
`storage aggregates show -node _node_name_`
+
For example, node1 is the node that will be halted or rebooted:
+
----
cluster::> storage aggregates show -node node1

                                                                normal

.. Move the aggregates to the partner node:
`storage aggregate relocation start -node _node_name_ -destination _node_name_ -aggregate-list _aggregate_name_`
+
For example, aggregates aggr1, aggr2 and test2_aggr are being moved from node1 to node2:
+
`storage aggregate relocation start -node _node1_ -destination _node2_ -aggregate-list _aggr1_,_aggr2_,_test2_aggr_`

. Disable cluster HA:
`cluster ha modify -configured false`
+
The return output confirms HA is disabled: `Notice: HA is disabled`
+
NOTE: This operation does not disable storage failover.

. Halt or reboot and inhibit takeover of the target node, by using the appropriate command:
+
* `system node halt -node _node_name_ -inhibit-takeover true`
* `system node reboot -node _node_name_ -inhibit-takeover true`
+
NOTE: In the command output, you will see a warning asking you if you want to proceed, enter `y`.

. Verify that the node that is still online is in a healthy state (while the partner is down):
`cluster show`
+
For the online node, `true` appears in the `Health` column.
+
NOTE: In the command output, you will see a warning that cluster HA is not configured. You can ignore the warning at this time.

. Perform the actions that required you to halt or reboot the node.
. Boot the offlined node from the LOADER prompt:
`boot_ontap`
. Verify both nodes are healthy:
`cluster show`
+
For both nodes, `true` appears in the `Health` column.
+
NOTE: In the command output, you will see a warning that cluster HA is not configured. You can ignore the warning at this time.

. Reenable cluster HA:
`cluster ha modify -configured true`

. If earlier in this procedure you relocated aggregates to the partner node, move them back to their home node; otherwise, go to the next step:
`storage aggregate relocation start -node _node_name_ -destination _node_name_ -aggregate-list _aggregate_name_`
+
For example, aggregates aggr1, aggr2 and test2_aggr are being moved from node node2 to node node1:
`storage aggregate relocation start -node _node2_ -destination _node1_ -aggregate-list _aggr1_,_aggr2_,_test2_aggr_`

. Revert LIFs to their home ports:
.. View LIFs that are not at home:
`network interface show -is-home false`
.. If there are non-home LIFs that were not migrated from the down node, verify it is safe to move them before reverting.
.. If it is safe to do so, revert all LIFs home.
 `network interface revert *`
