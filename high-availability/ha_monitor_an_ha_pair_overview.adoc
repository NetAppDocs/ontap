You can use ONTAP commands to monitor the status of the HA pair. If a takeover occurs, you  can also determine what caused the takeover.

|===

h|If you want to check h|Use this command

|Whether failover is enabled or has occurred, or reasons why failover is not currently possible
|`storage failover show`
|View the nodes on which the storage failover HA-mode setting is enabled
You must set the value to ha for the node to participate in a storage failover (HA pair) configuration.
|`storage failover show -fields mode`
|Whether hardware-assisted takeover is enabled
|`storage failover hwassist show`
|The history of hardware-assisted takeover events that have occurred
|`storage failover hwassist stats show`
|The progress of a takeover operation as the partner's aggregates are moved to the node doing the takeover
|`storage failover show‑takeover`
|The progress of a giveback operation in returning aggregates to the partner node
|`storage failover show‑giveback`
|Whether an aggregate is home during takeover or giveback operations
|`aggregate show ‑fields home‑id,owner‑id,home‑name,owner‑name,is‑home`
|Whether cluster HA is enabled (applies only to two node clusters)
|`cluster ha show`
|The HA state of the components of an HA pair (on systems that use the HA state)
|`ha‑config show`
This is a Maintenance mode command.

== Node states displayed by storage failover show-type commands

The following list describes the node states that the `storage failover show` command displays.

h|Node State  h|Description
a|Connected to partner_name, Automatic takeover disabled.
a|The HA interconnect is active and can transmit data to the partner node. Automatic takeover of the partner is disabled.
a|Waiting for partner_name, Giveback of partner spare disks pending.
