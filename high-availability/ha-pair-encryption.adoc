[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.18.1, you can configure encrypted communication between HA pair nodes. This encryption protects customer data and metadata sent between the nodes of an HA pair.

.About this task
* Encryption for HA pair communication is disabled by default.
* Enabling or disabling HA pair encryption affects all HA pairs in the cluster. You cannot enable or disable encryption for individual HA pairs.
* When you enable encryption for HA pair communication, all customer data and metadata is encrypted when transmitted between HA pair nodes. Some traffic, such as filesystem metadata and heartbeat messages, is not encrypted.

.Before you begin
* You must be an ONTAP administrator at the `cluster` privilege level to perform the following procedure.

.Steps

. View the current encryption status for HA pair communication:
+
[source, cli]
----
security ha-network show
----
This command shows the current status of HA pair encryption for each node.

. Enable or disable encryption for HA pair communication:
+
[source, cli]
----
security ha-network modify -enabled <true|false>
----
This command enables or disables encrypted communication for all HA pairs.
