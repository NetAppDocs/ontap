= Configure encryption for ONTAP HA traffic
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.18.1, you can configure encryption for network traffic between high-availability (HA) pair nodes. This encryption protects customer data and metadata sent between nodes in an HA pair.

.About this task
* Encryption for HA traffic is disabled by default.
* Enabling or disabling HA traffic encryption affects all HA pairs in the cluster. You cannot enable or disable encryption for individual nodes.
* When you enable HA traffic encryption, all customer data and metadata transmitted between HA pair nodes is encrypted. Some HA traffic, such as filesystem metadata and heartbeat messages, is not encrypted.

.Before you begin
* You must be an ONTAP administrator at the `admin` privilege level to perform the following procedure.
* An external key management server (KMS) is required to manage encryption keys for HA traffic. The KMS must be configured before you can enable HA traffic encryption.
* All nodes in the cluster must be running ONTAP 9.18.1 or later to enable HA traffic encryption.

.Steps

. View the current encryption status for HA traffic:
+
[source, cli]
----
security ha-network show
----
This command shows the current status of HA traffic encryption for each node:
+
```
security ha-network show
Node                  Enabled             
--------------------- --------------------
node1                 true                  
node2                 true                  
node3                 true
node4                 true
4 entries were displayed.
```

. Enable or disable encryption for HA traffic:

[source, cli]
----
security ha-network modify -enabled <true|false>
----
This command enables or disables encrypted HA traffic for all nodes in the cluster.
