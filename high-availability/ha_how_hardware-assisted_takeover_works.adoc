Enabled by default, the hardware-assisted takeover feature can speed up the takeover process by using a node's remote management device (Service Processor).

When the remote management device detects a failure, it quickly initiates the takeover rather than waiting for ONTAP to recognize that the partner's heartbeat has stopped. If a failure occurs without this feature enabled, the partner waits until it notices that the node is no longer giving a heartbeat, confirms the loss of heartbeat, and then initiates the takeover.

The hardware-assisted takeover feature uses the following process to avoid that wait:

. The remote management device monitors the local system for certain types of failures.
. If a failure is detected, the remote management device immediately sends an alert to the partner node.
. Upon receiving the alert, the partner initiates takeover.

== System events that trigger hardware-assisted takeover

The partner node might generate a takeover depending on the type of alert it receives from the remote management device (Service Processor).

h| Alert h| Takeover initiated upon receipt? h| Description

|abnormal_reboot
|No
|An abnormal reboot of the node occurred.
|l2_watchdog_reset
|Yes
|The system watchdog hardware detected an L2 reset.
The remote management device detected a lack of response from the system CPU and reset the system.
|loss_of_heartbeat
|No
|The remote management device is no longer receiving the heartbeat message from the node.
This alert does not refer to the heartbeat messages between the nodes in the HA pair; it refers to the heartbeat between the node and its local remote management device.
|periodic_message
|No
|A periodic message is sent during a normal hardware-assisted takeover operation.
|power_cycle_via_sp
|Yes
|The remote management device cycled the system power off and on.
|power_loss
|Yes
|A power loss occurred on the node.
The remote management device has a power supply that maintains power for a short period after a power loss, allowing it to report the power loss to the partner.
|power_off_via_sp
|Yes
|The remote management device powered off the system.
|reset_via_sp
|Yes
|The remote management device reset the system.
|test
|No
|A test message is sent to verify a hardware-assisted takeover  operation.
