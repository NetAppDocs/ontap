[.lead]
In certain situations, you might need to manage your automatic giveback settings using ONTAP commands.

[cols=2*,options="header"]
|===
a|
*If you want to...*
|*Use this command...*
a|
Enable automatic giveback so that giveback occurs as soon as the taken-over node boots, reaches the Waiting for Giveback state, and the Delay before Auto Giveback period has expired.

The default setting is true.
a|
storage failover modify ‑node _nodename_

‑auto‑giveback true
a|
Disable automatic giveback. The default setting is true.

*Note:* Setting this parameter to false does not disable automatic giveback after takeover on panic and takeover on reboot; automatic giveback after takeover on panic must be disabled by setting the `‑auto‑giveback‑after‑panic` parameter to false.
a|
storage failover modify ‑node _nodename_

‑auto‑giveback false
a|
Disable automatic giveback after takeover on panic (this setting is enabled by default).
a|
storage failover modify ‑node _nodename_

‑auto‑giveback‑after‑panic false

a|
Delay automatic giveback for a specified number of seconds (default is 600). This option determines the minimum time that a node remains in takeover before performing an automatic giveback.
a|
storage failover modify ‑node _nodename_

‑delay‑seconds _seconds_

== How variations of the storage failover modify command affect automatic giveback

The operation of automatic giveback depends on how you configure the parameters of the storage failover modify command.

The following table lists the storage failover modify command parameters that apply to takeover events not caused by a panic:


[cols=2*,options="header"]
|===
a|
*Parameter*
a|
*Default setting*
a|
-auto-giveback _true_ \| _false_
a|
_true_
a|
-delay-seconds _integer_ (seconds)
a|
600
a|
-onreboot _true_ \| _false_
a|
_true_
|===


The following table describes how combinations of the `-onreboot` and `-auto-giveback` parameters affect automatic giveback for takeover events not caused by a panic.


[cols=3*,options="header"]
|===
a|
*storage failover modify parameters used*
|*Cause of takeover* |*Does automatic giveback occur?*
a|
-onreboot _true_

-auto-giveback _true_

|reboot command |Yes

| |halt command, or power cycle operation issued from the Service Processor |Yes

a|
-onreboot _true_

-auto-giveback _false_

|reboot command |Yes

| |halt command, or power cycle operation issued from the Service Processor |No

a|
-onreboot _false_

-auto-giveback _true_

|reboot command |No

| |halt command, or power cycle operation issued from the Service Processor |Yes

a|
-onreboot _false_

-auto-giveback _false_

|reboot command |No

| |halt command, or power cycle operation issued from the Service Processor |No
|===

[NOTE]
If the `-onreboot` parameter is set to true and a takeover occurs due to a reboot, then automatic giveback is always performed, regardless of whether the `-auto-giveback` parameter is set to true.

When the `-onreboot` parameter is set to false, a takeover does not occur in the case of a node reboot. Therefore, automatic giveback cannot occur, regardless of whether the `-auto-giveback` parameter is set to true. A client disruption occurs.

== The effects of automatic giveback parameter combinations that apply to panic situations.

The following table lists the `storage failover modify` command parameters that apply to panic situations:


[cols=2*,options="header"]
|===
a|
*Parameter*
a|
*Default setting*
a|
-onpanic _true \| false_

|_true_
a|
-auto-giveback-after-panic _true \| false_

(Privilege: Advanced)

|_true_
|-auto-giveback _true \| false_
a|
_true_
|===


The following table describes how parameter combinations of the `storage failover modify` command affect automatic giveback in panic situations.


[cols=2*,options="header"]
|===
|storage failover parameters used |Does automatic giveback occur after panic?

|-onpanic `false`
-auto-giveback-after-panic `true`
|No
|-onpanic `false`
-auto-giveback-after-panic `false`
|No
|-onpanic `true`
-auto-giveback `true`
-auto-giveback-after-panic `true`
|Yes
|-onpanic `true`
-auto-giveback `true`
-auto-giveback-after-panic `false`
|No
|-onpanic `true`
-auto-giveback `false`
-auto-giveback-after-panic `true`
|Yes
|-onpanic `true`
-auto-giveback `false`
-auto-giveback-after-panic `false`
|No
|-onpanic `false`
If -onpanic is set to `false`, takeover/giveback does not occur, regardless of the value set for -auto-giveback or - auto-giveback-after-panic
|No
|===

NOTE: If the -onpanic parameter is set to `true`, automatic giveback is always performed if a panic occurs unless you have changed the default settings for the -auto-giveback and -auto-giveback-after-panic parameters. If both of these parameters are changed from their default (`true`,) to `false`, then an automatic giveback will not  occur after a panic, even if the -onpanic parameter is set to `true`.

If the -onpanic parameter is set to `false`, takeover does not occur. Therefore, automatic giveback cannot occur, even if the  auto giveback after panic parameter is set to `true`. A client disruption occurs.
