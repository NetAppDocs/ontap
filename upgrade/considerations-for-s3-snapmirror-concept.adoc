[.lead]
Before you upgrade ONTAP, if you are using SnapMirror S3, and you are upgrading to ONTAP 9.12.1 or later, you should verify that you have the proper SnapMirror licenses. 

After upgrading ONTAP, licensing changes that occurred between ONTAP 9.11.1 and earlier and ONTAP 9.12.1 and later might cause SnapMirror S3 relationships to fail.

== ONTAP 9.11.1 and earlier

* When replicating to a NetApp-hosted destination bucket (ONTAP S3 or StorageGRID), SnapMirror S3 checks for the SnapMirror synchronous license, included in the Data Protection Bundle prior to the introduction of the link:../system-admin/manage-licenses-concept.html[ONTAP One] software suite.

* When replicating to a non-NetApp destination bucket, SnapMirror S3 checks for the SnapMirror cloud license, included in the Hybrid Cloud Bundle which was available prior to the introduction of the link:../system-admin/manage-licenses-concept.html[ONTAP One] software suite.

== ONTAP 9.12.1 and later

* When replicating to a NetApp-hosted destination bucket (ONTAP S3 or StorageGRID), SnapMirror S3 checks for the SnapMirror S3 license, included in the Data Protection bundle which was available prior to the introduction of the link:../system-admin/manage-licenses-concept.html[ONTAP One] software suite.

* When replicating to a non-NetApp destination bucket, SnapMirror S3 checks for the SnapMirror S3 External license, included in the Hybrid Cloud Bundle which was available prior to the introduction of link:../system-admin/manage-licenses-concept.html[ONTAP One] software suite and the link:../data-protection/install-snapmirror-cloud-license-task.html[ONTAP One Compatibility bundle].

== Existing SnapMirror S3 relationships

Existing SnapMirror S3 relationships should continue to work after an upgrade from ONTAP 9.11.1 or earlier to ONTAP 9.12.1 or later, even if the cluster does not have the new licensing.

Creation of new SnapMirror S3 relationships will fail if the cluster does not have the proper license installed.
