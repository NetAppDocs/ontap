You should plan for at least 30 minutes to complete preparatory steps for an ONTAP upgrade, 60 minutes to upgrade each HA pair, and at least 30 minutes to complete post-upgrade steps.

NOTE: If you are using NetApp Encryption with an external key management server and the Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP), you should expect the upgrade for each HA pair to be longer than one hour. 

These upgrade duration guidelines are based on typical configurations and workloads. You can use these guidelines to estimate the time it will take to perform a nondisruptive upgrade in your environment. The actual duration of your upgrade process will depend on your individual environment and the number of nodes.
