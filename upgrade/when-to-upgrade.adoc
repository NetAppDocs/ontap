[.lead]
You should upgrade your ONTAP software on a regular cadence. Upgrading ONTAP allows you to take advantage of new and enhanced features and functionality and implement current fixes for known issues.

== Major ONTAP upgrades

A major ONTAP upgrade or feature release typically includes:

** New ONTAP features
** Key infrastructure changes, such as fundamental changes to NetApp WAFL operation or RAID operation
** Support for new NetApp-engineered hardware systems 
** Support for replacement hardware components such as newer network interface cards or host bus adapters

New ONTAP releases are entitled to full support for 3 years. NetApp recommends that you run the newest release for 1 year after general availability (GA) and then use the remaining time within the full support window to plan for your transition to a newer ONTAP release. 

== ONTAP patch upgrades

Patch upgrades deliver timely fixes for critical bugs that cannot wait for the next major ONTAP feature release. Non-critical patch upgrades should be applied every 3-6 months. Critical patch upgrades should be applied as soon as possible.
