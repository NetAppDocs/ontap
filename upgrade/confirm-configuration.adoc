Before you upgrade ONTAP, you should confirm that your hardware configuration can support the target ONTAP release.

== All configurations

Use https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe^] to confirm that your hardware platform and cluster and management switches are supported in the target ONTAP release.  

The version of ONTAP that you can upgrade to might be limited based upon your hardware configuration. If your hardware doesn't support the version of ONTAP software that you want to upgrade to, you will need to first add new nodes to your cluster, migrate your data, remove the older nodes and then upgrade your ONTAP software. Follow the procedure to link:concept_mixed_version_requirements.html#adding-new-nodes-to-an-ontap-cluster[add new nodes to an ONTAP cluster].

Cluster and management switches include the cluster network switches (NX-OS), management network switches (IOS), and reference configuration file (RCF).  If your cluster and management switches are supported but are not running the minimum software versions required for the target ONTAP release, upgrade your switches to supported software versions.

[NOTE]
If you need to upgrade your switches, NetApp recommends that you complete the ONTAP software upgrade first, then perform the software upgrade for your switches.  

== MetroCluster configurations

Before you upgrade ONTAP, if you have a MetroCluster configuration, use the https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to confirm that your MetroCluster IP switches are supported in the target ONTAP release.

== SAN configurations

Before you upgrade ONTAP, if your cluster is configured for SAN, use the https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to confirm that the SAN configuration is fully supported.

All SAN components--including the target ONTAP software version, host OS and patches, required Host Utilities software, multipathing software, and adapter drivers and firmware--should be supported.
