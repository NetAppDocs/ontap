Before you upgrade a cluster, you should verify that the nodes are healthy and eligible to participate in the cluster, and that the cluster is in quorum.

. Verify that the nodes in the cluster are online and are eligible to participate in the cluster: `cluster show`
+
----
cluster1::> cluster show
Node                  Health  Eligibility
--------------------- ------- ------------
node0                 true    true
node1                 true    true
----
+
If any node is unhealthy or ineligible, check EMS logs for errors and take corrective action.

. If you are operating in a SAN environment, verify that each node is in a SAN quorum: `event log show -messagename scsiblade.*`
+
The most recent scsiblade event message for each node should indicate that the scsi-blade is in quorum.
+
----
cluster1::*> event log show -messagename scsiblade.*
Time                Node             Severity      Event
------------------- ---------------- ------------- ---------------------------
MM/DD/YYYY TIME  node0            INFORMATIONAL scsiblade.in.quorum: The scsi-blade ...
MM/DD/YYYY TIME  node1            INFORMATIONAL scsiblade.in.quorum: The scsi-blade ...
----

. Return to the admin privilege level: `set -privilege admin`
