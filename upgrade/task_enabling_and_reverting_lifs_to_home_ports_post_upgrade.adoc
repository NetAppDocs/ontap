During the reboot that occurs as part of the ONTAP upgrade process, some LIFs might be migrated from their home ports to their assigned failover ports. After an upgrade, you need to enable and revert any LIFs that are not on their home ports.

.Steps

. Display the status of all LIFs:
+
[source,cli]
----
network interface show -fields home-port,curr-port
----
+
If *Status Admin* is "down" or *Is home* is "false" for any LIFs, continue with the next step.

. Enable the data LIFs: 
+
[source,cli]
----
network interface modify {-role data} -status-admin up
----

. Revert LIFs to their home ports: 
+
[source,cli]
----
network interface revert *
----

. Verify that all LIFs are in their home ports: 
+
[source,cli]
----
network interface show
----
+
This example shows that all LIFs for SVM vs0 are on their home ports.
