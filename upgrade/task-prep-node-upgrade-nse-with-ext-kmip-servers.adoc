[.lead]
Before you upgrade ONTAP, if you are running ONTAP 9.2 or earlier with NetApp Storage Encryption (NSE) and upgrading to ONTAP 9.3 or later, you must use the command line interface (CLI) to delete any existing external key management (KMIP) server connections.

.Steps

. Verify that the NSE drives are unlocked, open, and set to the default manufacture secure ID 0x0:
+
[source,cli]
----
storage encryption disk show -disk *
----
+
Learn more about `storage encryption disk show` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/storage-encryption-disk-show.html[ONTAP command reference^].

. Enter the advanced privilege mode:
+
[source,cli]
----
set -privilege advanced
----
+
Learn more about `set` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/set.html[ONTAP command reference^].

. Use the default manufacture secure ID 0x0 to assign the FIPS key to the self-encrypting disks (SEDs): 
+
[source,cli]
----
storage encryption disk modify -fips-key-id 0x0 -disk *
----
+
Learn more about `storage encryption disk modify` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/storage-encryption-disk-modify.html[ONTAP command reference^].

. Verify that assigning the FIPS key to all disks is complete: 
+
[source,cli]
----
storage encryption disk show-status
----
+
Learn more about `storage encryption disk show-status` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/storage-encryption-disk-show-status.html[ONTAP command reference^].

. Verify that the *mode* for all disks is set to data

+
[source,cli]
----
security key-manager delete -address <kmip_ip_address>
----
+
Learn more about `security key-manager delete` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/security-key-manager-key-delete.html[ONTAP command reference^].

. Delete the external key manager configuration:
