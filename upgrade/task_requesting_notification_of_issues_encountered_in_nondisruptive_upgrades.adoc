If you do not plan to monitor the progress of the upgrade process, it is a good practice to request EMS notifications of errors that might require manual intervention. Alternatively, you can configure an AutoSupport message to send to your internal support organization.

You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.

It is useful to set up notifications such that they are sent in case of a problem during the upgrade process. In particular, the callhome.andu.pausederr message contains useful troubleshooting information.

If the AutoSupport noteto parameter is configured with email addresses, they are automatically copied into EMS notification destinations when upgrading to ONTAP 9 or 9.1. A new EMS notification is also created that maps the important-events filter to these addresses. As a result, you will start receiving two email notifications for each callhome event until you remove the email addresses from the AutoSupport noteto parameter. You will also start receiving email notifications about other important events that are originally configured.

NOTE: If your cluster is not configured to send AutoSupport messages, a copy of the notification is saved locally.

. Before initiating a nondisruptive upgrade, if AutoSupport is enabled on this cluster, suppress automatic case creation by invoking an AutoSupport message. If AutoSupport is not enabled on this cluster, then ignore this step: `system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=xh`
+
x is the duration of the maintenance window in hours.
+
NOTE: The message will notify technical support of this maintenance task so that automatic case creation is suppressed during the maintenance window.
+
This command suppresses automatic case creation for two hours:
+
----
cluster::*> system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=2h
----

. After the nondisruptive upgrade, reenable automatic case creation by invoking an AutoSupport message: `system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=END`
+
The command reenables automatic case creation:
+
----
cluster::*> system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=END
----
