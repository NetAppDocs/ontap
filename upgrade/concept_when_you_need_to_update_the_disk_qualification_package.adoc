[.lead]

After you upgrade your ONTAP software, you should download and install the ONTAP Disk Qualification Package (DQP).  The DQP is not updated as part of an ONTAP upgrade.

The DQP contains the proper parameters for ONTAP interaction with all newly qualified drives. If your version of the DQP does not contain information for a newly qualified drive, ONTAP will not have the information to properly configure the drive.  

It is best practice to update the DQP every quarter.  You should also update the DQP for the following reasons:

* Whenever you add a new drive type or size to a node in your cluster  
+
For example, if you already have 1-TB drives and add 2-TB drives, you need to check for the latest DQP update.
* Whenever you update the disk firmware
* Whenever newer disk firmware or DQP files are available
