[.lead]
If you can take your cluster offline to upgrade to a new ONTAP release, then you can use the disruptive upgrade method. This method has several steps: disabling storage failover for each HA pair, rebooting each node in the cluster, and then reenabling storage failover.

* You must link:download-software-image.html[download] and link:install-software-manual-upgrade.html[install] the software image.

* If you are operating in a SAN environment, all SAN clients must be shut down or suspended until the upgrade is complete.
+
If SAN clients are not shut down or suspended prior to a disruptive upgrade , then the client file systems and applications suffer errors that might require manual recovery after the upgrade is completed.

In a disruptive upgrade, downtime is required because storage failover is disabled for each HA pair, and each node is updated. When storage failover is disabled, each node behaves as a single-node cluster; that is, system services associated with the node are interrupted for as long as it takes the system to reboot.

.Steps

. Set the privilege level from admin to advanced, entering *y* when prompted to continue:
+
[source,cli]
----
set -privilege advanced
----
+
The advanced prompt (`*>`) appears.

. Set the new ONTAP software image to be the default image: 
+
[source,cli]
----
system image modify {-node * -iscurrent false} -isdefault true
----
+
This command uses an extended query to change the target ONTAP software image (which is installed as the alternate image) to be the default image for each node.

. Verify that the new ONTAP software image is set as the default image: 
+
[source,cli]
----
system image show
----
+
In the following example, image 2 is the new ONTAP version and is set as the default image on both nodes:
+
----
cluster1::*> system image show
                 Is      Is                Install
Node     Image   Default Current Version    Date
-------- ------- ------- ------- --------- -------------------
node0
         image1  false   true    X.X.X     MM/DD/YYYY TIME
         image2  true    false   Y.Y.Y     MM/DD/YYYY TIME
node1
         image1  false   true    X.X.X     MM/DD/YYYY TIME
         image2  true    false   Y.Y.Y     MM/DD/YYYY TIME

. Perform either one of the following steps:
+
[cols=2*,options="header"]
|===
| If the cluster consists of...| Do this...
a|
One node
a|
Continue to the next step.
a|
Two nodes
a|

.. Disable cluster high availability: 
+
[source,cli]
----
cluster ha modify -configured false
----
+
Enter `y` to continue when prompted.

.. Disable storage failover for the HA pair:
+
[source,cli]
----
storage failover modify -node * -enabled false
----

a|
More than two nodes
a|
Disable storage failover for each HA pair in the cluster: 
[source,cli]
----
storage failover modify -node * -enabled false
----
|===

. Reboot a node in the cluster: 
+
[source,cli]
----
system node reboot -node nodename -ignore-quorum-warnings
----
+
IMPORTANT: Do not reboot more than one node at a time.
+
The node boots the new ONTAP image. The ONTAP login prompt appears, indicating that the reboot process is complete.

. After the node or set of nodes has rebooted with the new ONTAP image, set the privilege level to advanced: 
+
[source,cli]
----
set -privilege advanced
----
+
Enter *y* when prompted to continue

. Confirm that the new software is running: 
+
[source,cli]
----
system node image show
----
+
In the following example, image1 is the new ONTAP version and is set as the current version on node0:
+
----
cluster1::*> system node image show
                 Is      Is                 Install
Node     Image   Default Current Version    Date
-------- ------- ------- ------- --------   -------------------
node0
         image1  true    true    X.X.X       MM/DD/YYYY TIME
         image2  false   false   Y.Y.Y      MM/DD/YYYY TIME
node1
         image1  true    false   X.X.X      MM/DD/YYYY TIME
         image2  false   true    Y.Y.Y      MM/DD/YYYY TIME
4 entries were displayed.
----

. Verify that the upgrade is completed successfully:

.. Set the privilege level to advanced: 
+
[source,cli]
----
set -privilege advanced
----

.. Verify that the upgrade status is complete for each node: 
+
[source,cli]
----
system node upgrade-revert show -node nodename
----
+
The status should be listed as complete.
+
If the status is not complete, link:http://mysupport.netapp.com/[contact NetApp Support^] immediately.

.. Return to the admin privilege level: 
+
[source,cli]
----
set -privilege admin
----
. Repeat Steps 5 through 8 for each additional node.
. If the cluster consists of two or more nodes, enable storage failover for each HA pair in the cluster: 
+
[source,cli]
----
storage failover modify -node * -enabled true
----
. If the cluster consists of only two nodes, enable cluster high availability: 
+
[source,cli]
----
cluster ha modify -configured true
