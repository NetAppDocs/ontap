[.lead]
After an ONTAP upgrade, in a SAN environment, you should verify that each initiator that was connected to a LIF before the upgrade has successfully reconnected to the LIF.

. Verify that each initiator is connected to the correct LIF.
+
You should compare the list of initiators to the list you made during the upgrade preparation. If you are running ONTAP 9.11.1 or later, use System Manager to view the connection status as it gives a much clearer display than CLI.
