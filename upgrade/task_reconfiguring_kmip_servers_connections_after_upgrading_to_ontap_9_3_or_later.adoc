After you upgrade from ONTAP 9.2 or earlier to ONTAP 9.3 or later, you need to reconfigure any external key management (KMIP) server connections.

.Steps

. Configure the key manager connectivity:
+
[source,cli]
----
security key-manager setup
----

. Add your KMIP servers: 
+
[source,cli]
----
security key-manager add -address <key_management_server_ip_address>
----

. Verify that KMIP servers are connected: 
+
[source,cli]
----
security key-manager show -status
----

. Query the key servers: 
+
[source,cli]
----
security key-manager query
----

. Create a new authentication key and passphrase: 
+
[source,cli]
----
security key-manager create-key -prompt-for-key true
----
+
The passphrase must have a minimum of 32 characters.

. Query the new authentication key: 
+
[source,cli]
----
security key-manager query
----

. Assign the new authentication key to your self-encrypting disks (SEDs): 
+
[source,cli]
----
storage encryption disk modify -disk <disk_ID> -data-key-id <key_ID>
----
+
NOTE: Make sure you are using the new authentication key from your query.

. If needed, assign a FIPS key to the SEDs: 
+
[source,cli]
----
storage encryption disk modify -disk <disk_id> -fips-key-id <fips_authentication_key_id>
----
+
If your security setup requires you to use different keys for data authentication and FIPS 140-2 authentication, you should create a separate key for each. If that is not the case, you can use the same authentication key for FIPS compliance that you use for data access.
