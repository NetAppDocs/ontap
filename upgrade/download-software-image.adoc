.About this task

* If you are performing an automated nondisruptive upgrade (ANDU) using a link:concept_upgrade_paths.html#types-of-upgrade-paths[direct multi-hop upgrade path], you need to link:download-software-image.html[download] the software package for both the intermediate ONTAP version and the target ONTAP version required for your upgrade.  For example, if you are upgrading from ONTAP 9.8 to ONTAP 9.13.1, you must download the software packages for both ONTAP 9.12.1 and ONTAP 9.13.1.  See link:concept_upgrade_paths.html#supported-upgrade-paths[supported upgrade paths] to determine if your upgrade path requires you to download an intermediate software package.

* If you are upgrading a system with NetApp Volume Encryption to ONTAP 9.5 or later, you must download the ONTAP software image for non-restricted countries, which includes NetApp Volume Encryption.
+
If you use the ONTAP software image for restricted countries to upgrade a system with NetApp Volume Encryption, the system panics and you lose access to your volumes.

* You do not need to download a separate software package for your firmware. The firmware update for your cluster is included with the ONTAP software upgrade package and is copied to each nodeâ€™s boot device. The new firmware is then installed as part of the upgrade process.

.Steps

. Locate the target ONTAP software in the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/ontap9/downloads-tab[Software Downloads^] area of the NetApp Support Site.
+
For an ONTAP Select upgrade, select *ONTAP Select Node Upgrade*.

. Copy the software image (for example, 97_q_image.tgz) to the appropriate location.
+
Depending on your ONTAP release, the location will be a directory an HTTP, HTTPS or FTP server from which the image will be served to the local system, or to a local folder on the storage system.
