You must first download the ONTAP software from the NetApp Support site; then you can install it.

== Download the software image

For ONTAP 9.4 and later, you can copy the ONTAP software image from the NetApp Support Site to a local folder. For upgrades from ONTAP 9.3 or earlier, you must copy the ONTAP software image to an HTTP server or FTP server on your network.

You should note the following important information:

* Software images are specific to platform models.
+
You must obtain the correct image for your cluster. Software images, firmware version information, and the latest firmware for your platform model are available on the NetApp Support Site.

* Software images include the latest version of system firmware that was available when a given version of ONTAP was released.
* If you are upgrading a system with NetApp Volume Encryption to ONTAP 9.5 or later, you must download the ONTAP software image for non-restricted countries, which includes NetApp Volume Encryption.
+
If you use the ONTAP software image for restricted countries to upgrade a system with NetApp Volume Encryption, the system panics and you lose access to your volumes.

* If you are upgrading from ONTAP 9.5 to 9.9.1, you must copy the software image for ONTAP 9.7 and 9.9.1.

* If you are upgrading from ONTAP 9.3 to 9.7, you must copy the software image for ONTAP 9.5 and 9.7.

. Locate the target ONTAP software in the link:http://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/software[Software Downloads] area of the NetApp Support Site.

. Copy the software image.

 ** For ONTAP 9.3 or earlier, copy the software image (for example, 93_q_image.tgz) from the NetApp Support Site to the directory on the HTTP server or FTP server from which the image will be served.

 ** For ONTAP 9.4 or later, copy the software image (for example, 97_q_image.tgz) from the NetApp Support Site to the directory on the HTTP server or FTP server from which the image will be served or to a local folder.

== Install the software image

You must install the target software image on the cluster's nodes.

* If you are upgrading a system with NetApp Volume Encryption to ONTAP 9.5 or later, you must have downloaded the ONTAP software image for non-restricted countries, which includes NetApp Volume Encryption.
+
If you use the ONTAP software image for restricted countries to upgrade a system with NetApp Volume Encryption, the system panics and you lose access to your volumes.

* If you are upgrading from ONTAP 9.5 directly to 9.9.1, you must download the software image for ONTAP 9.7 and 9.9.1.  If you are upgrading from ONTAP 9.3 directly to 9.7, you must download the software image for ONTAP 9.5 and 9.7.
+
The automated upgrade process uses both images in the background to complete the upgrade.

. Set the privilege level to advanced, entering *y* when prompted to continue: `set -privilege advanced`
+
The advanced prompt (`*>`) appears.

=== For automatic nondisruptive upgrade (ANDU)

. Check the image repository and delete any previous images.
+
`cluster image package show-repository`
+
----
cluster image package show-repository\
<<smoke6-vsim-ucs6b4c#c-login_27|There are no packages in the repository.\r\n
----

. Download the image.
+
`cluster image package get -url url_to_image_on_nss`
+
.Example
+
`cluster image package get -url http://10.60.132.98/x/eng/rlse/DOT/9.7P13X2/promo/9.7P13X2/x86_64.optimize/image.tgz`

. Verify the package is downloaded.
+
`cluster image package show-repository`
+
.Example
+
----
cluster image package show-repository -fields download-ver\
<<smoke6-vsim-ucs6b4c#c-login_27| download-verX;X\r\n
<<smoke6-vsim-ucs6b4c#c-login_27| Downloaded VersionX;X\r\n
<<smoke6-vsim-ucs6b4c#c-login_27| Stormking__9.10.0X;X\r\n

=== For manual upgrades

. Download the image.

.. If you are upgrading a non-MetroCluster configuration or a two-node MetroCluster configuration use the following command to download the image:
+
`system node image update -node * -package location -replace-package true -setdefault true -background true`
+
NOTE: This command downloads and installs the software image on all of the nodes simultaneously. To download and install the image on each node one at a time, do not specify the -background parameter.

.. If you are upgrading a four or eight-node MetroCluster configuration, you must issue the following command on both clusters:
+
`system node image update -node * -package location -replace-package true true -background true -setdefault false`
+
This command uses an extended query to change the target software image, which is installed as the alternate image on each node.

. Enter `y` to continue when prompted.
. Verify that the software image is downloaded and installed on each node.
+
`system node image show-update-progress -node *`
+
This command displays the current status of the software image download and installation. You should continue to run this command until all nodes report a *Run Status* of *Exited*, and an *Exit Status* of *Success*.
+
The system node image update command can fail and display error or warning messages. After resolving any errors or warnings, you can run the command again.
+
This example shows a two-node cluster in which the software image is downloaded and installed successfully on both nodes:
+
----
cluster1::*> system node image show-update-progress -node *

        Exit Message:   After a clean shutdown, image2 will be set as the default boot image on node0.
