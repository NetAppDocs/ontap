[.lead]
Before you upgrade to ONTAP 9.16.1 or later, you should respond to any abnormal activity warnings reported by Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP). In ONTAP 9.16.1, ARP changed to a machine learning/artificial intelligence (AI)-based model. Because of this change, any unresolved active warnings from the existing ARP in ONTAP 9.15.1 or earlier will be lost after upgrade.

.Steps

. Respond to any abnormal activity warnings reported by link:../anti-ransomware/respond-abnormal-task.html[ARP] and resolve any potential issues.

. Confirm the resolution of these issues before upgrading by selecting *Update and Clear Suspect File Types* to record your decision and resume normal ARP monitoring.
