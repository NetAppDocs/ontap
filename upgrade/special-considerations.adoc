Certain cluster configurations require you to take specific actions before you begin an ONTAP software upgrade.  For example, if you have a SAN configuration, you should verify that each host is configured with the correct number of direct and indirect paths before you begin the upgrade. 

Review the following table to determine what additional steps you might need to take.

| Before you upgrade ONTAP, ask yourself...
| If your answer is *yes*, then do this...

| Is my cluster currently in a mixed version state?
