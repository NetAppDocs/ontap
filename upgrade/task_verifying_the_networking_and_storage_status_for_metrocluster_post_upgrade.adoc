[.lead]
After you upgrade an ONTAP cluster in a MetroCluster configuration, you should verify the status of the LIFs, aggregates, and volumes for each cluster.

. Verify the LIF status: 
+
[source,cli]
----
network interface show
----
+
In normal operation, LIFs for source SVMs must have an admin status of up and be located on their home nodes. LIFs for destination SVMs are not required to be up or located on their home nodes. In switchover, all LIFs have an admin status of up, but they do not need to be located on their home nodes.

. Verify the state of the aggregates: 
+
[source,cli]
----
storage aggregate show -state !online
----
+
This command displays any aggregates that are _not_ online. In normal operation, all aggregates located at the local site must be online. However, if the MetroCluster configuration is in switchover, root aggregates at the disaster recovery site are permitted to be offline.
+
This example shows a cluster in normal operation:
+
----
cluster1::> storage aggregate show -state !online
There are no entries matching your query.
----
+
This example shows a cluster in switchover, in which the root aggregates at the disaster recovery site are offline:

. Verify the state of the volumes: 
+
[source,cli]
----
volume show -state !online
----
+
This command displays any volumes that are _not_ online.
+
If the MetroCluster configuration is in normal operation (it is not in switchover state), the output should show all volumes owned by the cluster's secondary SVMs (those with the SVM name appended with "-mc").
+
Those volumes come online only in the event of a switchover.
+
This example shows a cluster in normal operation, in which the volumes at the disaster recovery site are not online.

. Verify that there are no inconsistent volumes:

[source,cli]
----
volume show -is-inconsistent true
