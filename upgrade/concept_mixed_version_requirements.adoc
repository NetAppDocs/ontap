[.lead]
A mixed version ONTAP cluster consists of nodes running two different major ONTAP releases for a limited time.  For example, if a cluster consists of nodes running ONTAP 9.8 and 9.12.1, the cluster is a mixed version cluster.  Similarly, a cluster in which nodes are running ONTAP 9.9.1 and 9.13.1 would be a mixed version cluster.  Clusters that have nodes running with different P or D patch levels of the same ONTAP release, such as ONTAP 9.9.1P1 and 9.9.1P5, are not considered mixed version ONTAP clusters. 

NetApp supports mixed version ONTAP clusters for limited periods of time and in specific scenarios.  The following are the  most common scenarios in which an ONTAP cluster is in a mixed version state:

* ONTAP software upgrades in large clusters
+
Upgrading the ONTAP software of a large cluster can span several days or weeks.  Your cluster is in a mixed version state for the period of time it takes to upgrade all the cluster node. 

* ONTAP software upgrades required when you plan to add new nodes to a cluster 
+
When you add new nodes to a cluster, you might need to upgrade the existing nodes to a version of ONTAP that is compatible with the new nodes.  The cluster is in a mixed version state for the period of time it takes to upgrade the existing nodes and add the new nodes to the cluster.

The information applies to ONTAP versions that support NetApp platforms systems, such as AFF A-Series and C-Series, ASA, and FAS, and C-series systems. The information does not apply to ONTAP cloud releases (9.x.0) such as 9.12.0.

[NOTE]
While the cluster is in a mixed version state, you should not enter any commands that alter the cluster operation or configuration except those that are required for the upgrade or data migration process.  For example, activities such as (but not limited to) LIF migration, planned storage failover operations, or large-scale object creation or deletion should not be performed until upgrade and data migration are complete.

== Mixed version clusters supported for ONTAP software upgrades

You can upgrade your ONTAP software to the highest ONTAP version supported for mixed version clusters based on your current release.  For example, if you are running ONTAP 9.12.1 you can enter a mixed version state to complete a direct upgrade to ONTAP 9.16.1.  If you need to upgrade to an ONTAP version that is not supported for a mixed version state based on your current ONTAP release, you must perform a multi-stage upgrade by first upgrading to the highest supported release; then performing a second upgrade to your target release.  For example, if you are running ONTAP 9.11.1 and you want to upgrade to ONTAP 9.16.1, you must first upgrade to ONTAP 9.15.1 which is the highest release supported for a mixed version state with ONTAP 9.11.1; then you can upgrade from ONTAP 9.15.1 to ONTAP 9.16.1

Learn more about link:concept_upgrade_paths.html#types-of-upgrade-paths[multi-stage upgrades] and link:concept_upgrade_paths.html#supported-upgrade-paths[supported upgrade paths].

Only two different major ONTAP versions are supported in a cluster at any given time. For example, ONTAP 9.9.1 and 9.13.1 is supported but ONTAP 9.9.1, 9.12.1, and 9.13.1 is not.

* For optimal cluster operation, the length of time that the cluster is in a mixed version state should be as short as possible.  The maximum length of time a cluster can remain in a mixed version state depends on the lowest ONTAP version in the cluster.

== Adding new nodes to an ONTAP cluster

If you plan to add new nodes to your cluster, and those nodes require a minimum version of ONTAP that's later than the version currently running in your cluster, you need to perform any supported software upgrades on the existing nodes in your cluster before adding the new nodes. Ideally, you would upgrade all existing nodes to the minimum version of ONTAP required by the nodes you plan to add to the cluster. However, if this is not possible because some of your existing nodes don't support the later version of ONTAP, you'll need to enter a mixed version state for a limited amount of time as part of your upgrade process. 

You might add new nodes to your cluster to expand its capacity, or you might add new nodes as part of the process of completely replacing your controllers. In either case, you need to enable the migration of your data from existing controllers to the new nodes in your new system.

.Steps

. link:concept_upgrade_methods.html[Upgrade] the nodes that do not support the minimum ONTAP version required by your new controllers to the maximum ONTAP version that they do support.  
+
For example, if you have a FAS8080 running ONTAP 9.5 and you are adding a new C-Series platform running ONTAP 9.12.1, you should upgrade your FAS8080 to ONTAP 9.8 (which is the maximum ONTAP version it supports).

. link:concept_upgrade_methods.html[Upgrade] the remaining nodes in your cluster to the same version as the new nodes.
+
Optionally, upgrade the entire cluster (including your new nodes) to the link:https://kb.netapp.com/Support_Bulletins/Customer_Bulletins/SU2[latest recommended patch release] of the ONTAP version running on the new nodes.
