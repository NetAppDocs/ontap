If you have an active link:https://www.netapp.com/us/services/support-edge.aspx[SupportEdge Services^] contract for link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq/upgrade_advisor_overview.html[Digital Advisor^], it is recommended that you use Upgrade Advisor to generate an upgrade plan. 

The Upgrade Advisor service in Digital Advisor provides intelligence that helps you plan your upgrade and minimizes uncertainty and risk.

Digital Advisor identifies issues in your environment that can be resolved by upgrading to a newer version of ONTAP. The Upgrade Advisor service helps you plan for a successful upgrade and provides a report of issues you might need to be aware of in the ONTAP version you're upgrading to.

NOTE: Upgrade Advisor requires a full AutoSupport bundle to create the report.

If you do not have an active Support Edge Services contract for Digital Advisor, you should link:prepare.html[prepare for your upgrade without Upgrade Advisor].
