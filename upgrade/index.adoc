The xref:concept_upgrade_methods.html[method you use to upgrade] your ONTAP software depends upon your configuration.  If it is supported by your configuration, you should perform an automated nondisruptive upgrade (ANDU) using System Manager.

If you have an active link:https://www.netapp.com/us/services/support-edge.aspx[SupportEdge] contract for link:https://aiq.netapp.com/[Active IQ Digital Advisor], before you begin your upgrade, you should launch Upgrade Advisor in Active IQ Digital Advisor to help you plan your upgrade.

The content in this section will guide you through the steps you should take before and after you upgrade, including the resources you should read and the necessary pre- and post-upgrade checks you should perform.
