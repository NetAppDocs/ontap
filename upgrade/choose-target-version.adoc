When you use Upgrade Advisor to generate an upgrade plan for your cluster, the plan includes a recommended target ONTAP release for upgrade.  The recommendation given by Upgrade Advisor is based on your current configuration and your current ONTAP version.

If you do not use Upgrade Advisor to plan your upgrade, you should choose your target ONTAP release for the upgrade based on NetApp recommendations or your need to be at the minimum release to meet your for performance needs.

* Upgrade to the latest available release (recommended)
+
NetApp recommends that you upgrade your ONTAP software to the latest patch version of the latest numbered ONTAP release.  If this is not possible because the latest numbered release is not supported by the storage systems in your cluster, you should upgrade to the latest numbered release that is supported.

* Minimum recommended release
+
If you want to restrict your upgrade to the minimum recommended release for your cluster, see link:https://kb.netapp.com/Support_Bulletins/Customer_Bulletins/SU2[Minimum recommended ONTAP releases^] to determine the ONTAP version you should upgrade to.
