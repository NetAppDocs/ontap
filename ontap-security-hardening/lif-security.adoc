[.lead]
A LIF is an IP address or worldwide port name (WWPN) with associated characteristics, such as a role, a home port, a home node, a list of ports to fail over to, and a firewall policy. You can configure LIFs on ports over which the cluster sends and receives communications over the network. It is critical to understand the security characteristics of each LIF role.

== LIF roles

LIF roles can be the following:

* *Data LIF*: A LIF associated with an SVM and used for communicating with clients.
* *Cluster LIF*: A LIF used to carry intracluster traffic between nodes in a cluster.
* *Node management LIF*: A LIF that provides a dedicated IP address for managing a particular node in a cluster.
* *Cluster management LIF*: A LIF that provides a single management interface for the entire cluster.
* *Intercluster LIF*: A LIF used for cross-cluster communication, backup, and replication.

| |Data LIF |Cluster LIF |Node management LIF |Cluster Management LIF |Intercluster LIF
|Requires private IP subnet? |No |Yes |No |No |No
|Requires secure network? |No |Yes |No |No |Yes
|Default firewall policy |Very restrictive |Completely open |Medium |Medium |Very restrictive
|Is the firewall customizable? |Yes |No |Yes |Yes |Yes

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Because the cluster LIF is completely open with no configurable firewall policy, it must be on a private IP subnet on a secure isolated network.
* LIF roles should never be exposed to the internet.
