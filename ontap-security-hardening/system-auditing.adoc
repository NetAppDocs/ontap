Ensure the integrity of event auditing by offloading ONTAP events to a remote syslog server. This server could be a security information event management system such as Splunk.

== Send out syslog

Log and audit information is invaluable to an organization from a support and availability standpoint. In addition, the information and details contained in logs (syslog) and audit reports and outputs are generally of a sensitive nature. To maintain security controls and posture, it is imperative that organizations manage log and audit data in a secure manner.

Offloading of syslog information is necessary for limiting the scope or footprint of a breach to a single system or solution. Therefore, NetApp recommends securely offloading syslog information to a secure storage or retention location.

=== Create a log-forwarding destination

Use the `cluster log-forwarding create` command to create log-forwarding destinations for remote logging. Learn more about `cluster log-forwarding create` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/cluster-log-forwarding-create.html[ONTAP command reference^].

.Parameters

Use the following parameters to configure the `cluster log-forwarding create` command:

* *Destination host.* This name is the host name or IPv4 or IPv6 address of the server to which to forward the logs.
+
----
-destination <Remote InetAddress>
----

* *Destination port.* This is the port on which the destination server listens.
+
----
[-port <integer>]
----

* *Log-forwarding protocol.* This protocol is used for sending messages to the destination.
+
----
[-protocol \{udp-unencrypted|tcp-unencrypted|tcp-encrypted}]
----
+
The log-forwarding protocol can use one of the following values:
+
** `udp-unencrypted`. User Datagram Protocol with no security.
** `tcp-unencrypted`. TCP with no security.
** `tcp-encrypted`. TCP with Transport Layer Security (TLS).

* *Verify destination server identity.* When this parameter is set to true, the identity of the log-forwarding destination is verified by validating its certificate. The value can be set to true only when the `tcpencrypted` value is selected in the protocol field.
+
----
[-verify-server \{true|false}]
----

* *Syslog facility.* This value is the syslog facility to use for the forwarded logs.
+
----
[-facility <Syslog Facility>]
----

* *Skip the connectivity test.* Normally, the `cluster log-forwarding create` command checks that the destination is reachable by sending an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) ping and fails if it is not reachable. Setting this value to `true` bypasses the ping check so that you can configure the destination when it is unreachable.
+
----
[-force [true]]
----

NOTE: NetApp recommends using the `cluster log-forwarding` command to force the connection to a `-tcp-encrypted` type.

== Event notification

Securing the information and data leaving a system is vital to maintaining and managing the system's security posture. The events generated by the ONTAP solution provide a wealth of information about what the solution is encountering, the information processed, and more. The vitality of this data highlights the need to manage and migrate it in a secure manner.

The `event notification create` command sends a new notification of a set of events defined by an event filter to one or more notification destinations. The following examples depict the event notification configuration and the `event notification show` command, which displays the configured event notification filters and destinations.

----
cluster1::> event notification create -filter-name filter1 -destinations
 email_dest,syslog_dest,snmp-traphost

cluster1::> event notification show
ID     Filter Name       Destinations
-----  ----------------  -----------------
1 filter1 email_dest, syslog_dest, snmp-traphost
