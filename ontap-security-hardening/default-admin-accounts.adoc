[.lead]
The admin account should be restricted because the role of administrator is allowed access using all applications. The diag account allows access to the system shell and should be reserved only for technical support to perform troubleshooting tasks.

There are two default administrative accounts: `admin` and `diag`.

Orphaned accounts are a major security vector that often leads to vulnerabilities, including the escalation of privileges. These are unnecessary and unused accounts that remain in the user account repository. They are primarily default accounts that were never used or for which passwords were never updated or changed. To address this issue, ONTAP supports the removal and renaming of accounts.

NOTE: ONTAP cannot remove or rename built-in accounts. However, NetApp recommends locking any unneeded built-in accounts with the lock command.

Although orphaned accounts are a significant security issue, NetApp strongly recommends testing the effect of removing accounts from the local account repository.

== List local accounts

To list the local accounts, run the `security login show` command.

== Set the diagnostic (diag) account password

A diagnostic account named `diag` is provided with your storage system. You can use the `diag` account to perform troubleshooting tasks in the `systemshell`. The `diag` account is the only account that can be used to access the systemshell through the `diag` privileged command `systemshell`. 

CAUTION: The systemshell and the associated `diag` account are intended for low-level diagnostic purposes. Their access requires the diagnostic privilege level and is reserved only to be used with guidance from technical support to perform troubleshooting tasks. Neither the `diag` account nor the `systemshell` is intended for general administrative purposes.

.Before you begin
Before accessing the `systemshell`, you must set the `diag` account password by using the `security login password` command. You should use strong password principles and change the `diag` password at regular intervals. 

.Steps

. Set the `diag` account user password:

Warning: The system shell provides access to low-level
diagnostic tools that can cause irreparable damage to
the system if not used properly. Use this environment
only when directed to do so by support personnel.
