[.lead]
As an administrator, you can view cluster-wide WebAuthn MFA settings and manage user and group credentials for WebAuthn MFA.

== View cluster settings for WebAuthn MFA
You can view the cluster settings for WebAuthn MFA using the ONTAP CLI.

.Steps

. View the cluster settings for WebAuthn MFA. You can optionally specify a storage VM using the `vserver` argument:
+
[source,console]
----
security webauthn show -vserver <storage_vm_name>
----

== View supported public key WebAuthn MFA algorithms
You can view the supported public key algorithms for WebAuthn MFA for a storage VM or for a cluster.

.Steps

. List the supported public key WebAuthn MFA algorithms. You can optionally specify a storage VM using the `vserver` argument: 
+
[source,console]
----
security webauthn supported-algorithms show -vserver <storage_vm_name>
----

== View the FIDO2 credentials registered for WebAuthn
As an administrator, you can view the registered FIDO2 credentials registered for WebAuthn for all users. Non-administrator users that use this procedure can only view their own registered FIDO2 credentials.

.Steps

. View the FIDO2 credentials registered for WebAuthn MFA:
+
[source,console]
----
security webauthn credentials show
----

== Remove a registered WebAuthn MFA credential
You can remove a registered WebAuthn MFA credential. This is useful when a user's hardware key was lost, stolen, or is no longer in use. You can also remove a registered credential when the user still has the original hardware authenticator, but wants to replace it with a new one. After removing the credential, the user will be prompted to register the replacement authenticator.

NOTE: Removing a registered credential for a user doesn't disable WebAuthn MFA for the user. If a user loses a hardware authenticator and needs to log in before replacing it, you need to remove the credential using these steps and also link:disable-webauthn-mfa-task.html[Disable WebAuthn MFA] for the user.
