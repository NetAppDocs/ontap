As an administrator, you can disable WebAuthn MFA for a user or group by editing the user or group with System Manager or the ONTAP CLI.

== Disable WebAuthn MFA for an existing user or group
You can disable WebAuthn MFA for an existing user or group at any time.

NOTE: If you disable registered credentials, the credentials are retained. If you re-enable the credentials in the future, the same credentials are used, so the user doesn't need to re-register upon logging in.
