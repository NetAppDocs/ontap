[.lead]
The NetApp All-Flash SAN Arrays (ASAs) are available beginning with ONTAP 9.7.  ASAs are all-flash SAN-only solutions built on proven AFF NetApp platforms.

[NOTE]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.16.0, a simplified ONTAP experience specific to SAN-only customers is available on ASA r2 systems (ASA A1K, ASA A90, ASA A70, ASA A50, ASA A30, or ASA A20).  If you have an ASA r2 system, see the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/asa-r2/index.html[ASA r2 system documentation^].

ASA platforms use symmetric active-active for multipathing. All paths are active/optimized so in the event of a storage failover, the host does not need to wait for the ALUA transition of the failover paths to resume I/O. This reduces time to failover.


== Set up an ASA

All-Flash SAN Arrays (ASAs) follow the same setup procedure as non-ASA systems.

System Manager guides you through the procedures necessary to initialize your cluster, create a local tier, configure protocols, and provision storage for your ASA. 

xref:../software_setup/concept_decide_whether_to_use_ontap_cli.html[Get started with ONTAP cluster set up].

== ASA host settings and utilities

Host settings for setting up All-Flash SAN Arrays (ASAs) are the same as those for all other SAN hosts.

You can download the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/software[NetApp Host Utilities software^] for your specific hosts from the support site.

== Ways to identify an ASA system

You can identify an ASA system using System Manager or using the ONTAP command line interface (CLI).

* *From the System Manager dashboard*: Click *Cluster > Overview* and then select the system node. 
+
The *PERSONALITY* is displayed as *All-Flash SAN Array*.

* *From the CLI*:  Enter the `san config show` command. 
+
The "All-Flash SAN Array" value returns as true for ASA systems.
