The role assigned to an administrator determines which functions the administrator can perform with System Manager. Predefined roles for cluster administrators and storage VM administrators are provided by System Manager.  You assign the role when you create the administrator’s account, or you can assign a different role later.

Depending on how you have enabled account access, you might need to perform any of the following:

* Associate a public key with a local account.
* Install a CA-signed server digital certificate.
* Configure AD, LDAP, or NIS access.

You can perform these tasks before or after enabling account access.
