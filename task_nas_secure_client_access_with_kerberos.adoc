Enable Kerberos to secure storage access for NAS clients.

This procedure configures Kerberos on an existing storage VM enabled for link:task_nas_enable_linux_nfs.html[NFS] or link:task_nas_enable_windows_smb.html[SMB].

Before beginning you should have configured DNS, NTP, and link:task_nas_provide_client_access_with_name_services.html[LDAP] on the storage system.

//Can steps 1-3 be accomplished in SM.Next? I’m not seeing any way to do so.
//I’m not sure how common this is in Kerberos deployments, but the Kerberos configuration and name mapping tasks are in different Settings sub-windows.

.Steps

. At the ONTAP command line, set UNIX permissions for the storage VM root volume.

.. Display the relevant permissions on the storage VM root volume: `volume show -volume _root_vol_name_-fields user,group,unix-permissions`. Learn more about `volume show` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/volume-show.html[ONTAP command reference^].
+
The root volume of the storage VM must have the following configuration:
+
[cols=2,options="header"]
|===
| Name... | Setting...
| UID | root or ID 0
| GID | root or ID 0
| UNIX permissions | 755
|===

.. If these values are not shown, use the `volume modify` command to update them. Learn more about `volume modify` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/volume-modify.html[ONTAP command reference^].

. Set user permissions for the storage VM root volume.

.. Display the local UNIX users: `vserver services name-service unix-user show -vserver _vserver_name_`. Learn more about `vserver services name-service unix-user show` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/vserver-services-name-service-unix-user-show.html[ONTAP command reference^].
+
The storage VM should have the following UNIX users configured:
+
[cols=3,options="header"]
|===
| User name | User ID | Primary group ID
| nfs | 500 | 0
| root | 0 | 0
|===
+
*Note:* The NFS user is not required if a Kerberos-UNIX name mapping exists for the SPN of the NFS client user; see step 5.

.. If these values are not shown, use the `vserver services name-service unix-user modify` command to update them. Learn more about `vserver services name-service unix-user modify` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/vserver-services-name-service-unix-user-modify.html[ONTAP command reference^].

. Set group permissions for the storage VM root volume.

.. Display the local UNIX groups: `vserver services name-service unix-group show -vserver _vserver_name_`. Learn more about `vserver services name-service unix-group show` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/vserver-services-name-service-unix-group-show.html[ONTAP command reference^].
+
The storage VM should have the following UNIX groups configured:
+
[cols=2,options="header"]
|===
| Group name | Group ID
| daemon | 1
| root | 0
|===

.. If these values are not shown, use the `vserver services name-service unix-group modify` command to update them. Learn more about `vserver services name-service unix-group modify` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/vserver-services-name-service-unix-group-modify.html[ONTAP command reference^].

. Switch to System Manager to configure Kerberos

. In System Manager, click *Storage > Storage VMs* and select the storage VM.

. Click *Settings*.

. Click image:icon_arrow.gif[Arrow icon] under Kerberos.

. Click *Add* under Kerberos Realm, and complete the following sections:
+
* Add Kerberos Realm
+
Enter configuration details depending on KDC vendor.
* Add Network Interface to Realm
+
Click *Add* and select a network interface.

. If desired, add mappings from Kerberos principal names to local user names.

.. Click *Storage > Storage VMs* and  select the storage VM.

.. Click *Settings*, and then click image:icon_arrow.gif[Arrow icon] under *Name Mapping*.

.. Under *Kerberos to UNIX*, add patterns and replacements using regular expressions.
