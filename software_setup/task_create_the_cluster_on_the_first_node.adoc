You use the Cluster Setup wizard to create the cluster on the first node. The wizard helps you to configure the cluster network that connects the nodes, create the cluster admin storage virtual machine (SVM), add feature license keys, and create the node management interface for the first node.

[NOTE]
This procedure applies to FAS, AFF, and current ASA systems. If you have an ASA r2 system (ASA A1K, ASA A90, ASA A70, ASA A50, ASA A30, or ASA A20), follow link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/asa-r2/install-setup/initialize-ontap-cluster.html[these steps^] to use System Manger to set up an ONTAP cluster. ASA r2 systems provide a simplified ONTAP experience specific to SAN-only customers.

.Before you begin

* You should have installed, cabled and powered on your new storage system according to the installation and setup instructions for your platform model.
See the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-systems/index.html[AFF and FAS documentation^].

* Cluster network interfaces should be configured on each node of the cluster for intra-cluster communication.

* If you are configuring IPv6 on your cluster, IPv6 should be configured on the Base Management Controller (BMC) so that you can access the system using SSH.

.Steps

. Power on all the nodes you are adding to the cluster. This is required to enable discovery for your cluster setup.
. Connect to the console of the first node.
+
The node boots, and then the Cluster Setup wizard starts on the console.
+
----
Welcome to the cluster setup wizard....
----

. Acknowledge the AutoSupport statement.
+
----
Type yes to confirm and continue {yes}: yes
----
+
NOTE: AutoSupport is enabled by default.

. Follow the instructions on the screen to assign an IP address to the node.
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, you can assign IPv6 addresses for management LIFs on A800 and FAS8700 platforms. For ONTAP releases earlier than 9.13.1, or for 9.13.1 and later on other platforms, you must assign IPv4 addresses for management LIFs, then convert to IPv6 after you complete cluster setup.

. Press *Enter* to continue.
+
----
Do you want to create a new cluster or join an existing cluster? {create, join}:
----

. Create a new cluster: `create`
. Accept the system defaults or enter your own values.
. After setup is completed, log in to the cluster and verify that the cluster is active and the first node is healthy by entering the ONTAP CLI command: `cluster show`
+
The following example shows a cluster in which the first node (cluster1-01) is healthy and eligible to participate:
+
----
cluster1::> cluster show
Node                  Health  Eligibility
--------------------- ------- ------------
cluster1-01           true    true
----
+
Learn more about `cluster show` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/cluster-show.html[ONTAP command reference^].
+
You can access the Cluster Setup wizard to change any of the values you entered for the admin SVM or node SVM by using the `cluster setup` command. Learn more about `cluster setup` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/cluster-setup.html[ONTAP command reference^].

.After you finish
