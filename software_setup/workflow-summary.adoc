NetApp recommends that you use System Manager to set up new clusters. System Manager provides a simple and easy workflow for cluster set up and configuration including assigning a node management IP address, initializing the cluster, creating a local tier, configuring protocols and provisioning initial storage.  It is only necessary to use the ONTAP command line interface (CLI) if you are running ONTAP 9.7 or earlier on a MetroCluster configuration.
