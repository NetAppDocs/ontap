NetApp recommends that you use System Manager to set up new clusters. System Manager provides a simple and easy workflow for cluster set up including assigning a node management IP address and initializing the cluster.  It is only necessary to use the ONTAP command line interface (CLI) if you are running ONTAP 9.7 or earlier on a MetroCluster configuration.

Before you begin your cluster setup, gather the information you need to complete the setup.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, you can assign IPv6 addresses to management LIFs on A800 and FAS8700 platforms during the initial cluster setup using the ONTAP command line interface (CLI).  For ONTAP releases earlier than 9.13.1, or for 9.13.1 and later on other platforms, you must first assign IPv4 addresses to management LIFs, and then convert to IPv6 addresses after you complete cluster setup.

After you have joined all the nodes to your new cluster, you should run Active IQ Config Advisor to validate your configuration and check for common configuration errors.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Synchronize the system time across your cluster to ensure that every node in the cluster has the same time and to prevent CIFS and Kerberos failures.
