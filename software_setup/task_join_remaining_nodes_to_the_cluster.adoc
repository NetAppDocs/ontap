[.lead]
After creating a new cluster, you use the Cluster Setup wizard to join each remaining node to the cluster one at a time. The wizard helps you to configure each node's node management interface.

[NOTE]
This procedure applies to FAS, AFF, and current ASA systems. If you have an ASA r2 system (ASA A1K, ASA A70, or ASA A90), follow link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/asa-r2/install-setup/initialize-ontap-cluster.html[these steps^] to use System Manger to set up an ONTAP cluster. ASA r2 systems provide a simplified ONTAP experience specific to SAN-only customers.

When you join two nodes in a cluster, you are creating a high availability (HA) pair. If you join 4 nodes, you create two HA pairs. To learn more about HA, see link:../high-availability/index.html[Learn about HA].

You can only join one node to the cluster at a time. When you start to join a node to the cluster, you must complete the join operation for that node, and the node must be part of the cluster before you can start to join the next node.

*Best Practice:* If you have a FAS2720 with 24 or fewer NL-SAS drives, you should verify that the storage configuration default is set to active/passive to optimize performance.
For more information, see documentation for link:../disks-aggregates/setup-active-passive-config-root-data-task.html[setting up an active-passive configuration on nodes using root-data partitioning].

. Log in to the node you plan to join in the cluster.
+
Cluster Setup wizard starts on the console.
+
----
Welcome to the cluster setup wizard....
----
. Acknowledge the AutoSupport statement.
+
NOTE: AutoSupport is enabled by default.

+
----
Type yes to confirm and continue {yes}: yes
----

. Follow the instructions on the screen to assign an IP address to the node.
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, you can assign IPv6 addresses for management LIFs on A800 and FAS8700 platforms.  For ONTAP releases earlier than 9.13.1, or for 9.13.1 and later on other platforms, you must assign IPv4 addresses for management LIFs, then convert to IPv6 after you complete cluster setup.

. Press *Enter* to continue.
+
----
Do you want to create a new cluster or join an existing cluster? {create, join}:
----

. Join the node to the cluster: `join`
. Follow the instructions on the screen to set up the node and join it to the cluster.
. After setup is completed, verify that the node is healthy and eligible to participate in the cluster: `cluster show`
+
The following example shows a cluster after the second node (cluster1-02) has been joined to the cluster:
+
----
cluster1::> cluster show
Node                  Health  Eligibility
--------------------- ------- ------------
cluster1-01           true    true
cluster1-02           true    true
----
+
You can access the Cluster Setup wizard to change any of the values you entered for the admin SVM or node SVM by using the cluster setup command.

. Repeat this task for each remaining node.

.After you finish
