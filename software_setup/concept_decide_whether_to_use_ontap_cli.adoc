If your configuration allows, NetApp recommends that you use System Manager to set up new clusters.  You should use the ONTAP Command Line Interface (CLI) if your version of System Manager does not support initial cluster setup for your configuration or if you need to setup an IPv6 network.

Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, on the A800 and FAS8700 platforms, you can use the ONTAP CLI to create and configure new clusters in IPv6-only networking environments.  If you need to use IPv6 in ONTAP 9.13.0 and earlier, or on other platforms in ONTAP 9.13.1 and later, you must create new clusters using IPv4 and then link:convert-ipv4-to-ipv6-task.html[convert to IPv6].

If you are configuring a FlexArray on non-NetApp disks, you need to use the ONTAP CLI to configure root volumes on the array LUNs, and then use the Cluster Setup wizard to set up your cluster.
