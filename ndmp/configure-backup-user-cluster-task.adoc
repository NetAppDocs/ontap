To authenticate SVM-scoped NDMP from the backup application, there must be an administrative user with sufficient privileges and an NDMP password. 

.About this task

You must generate an NDMP password for backup admin users. You can enable backup admin users at the cluster or SVM level, and if necessary, you can create a new user. By default, the users with the following roles can authenticate for NDMP backup:

* Cluster-wide: `admin` or `backup`
* Individual SVMs: `vsadmin` or `vsadmin-backup`

If you are using an NIS or LDAP user, the user must exist on the respective server. You cannot use an Active Directory user.

.Steps

. Display the current admin users and permissions:
+
`security login show`

. If needed, create a new NDMP backup user with the `security login create` command and the appropriate role for cluster-wide or individual SVM privileges.
+
You can specify a local backup user name or an NIS or LDAP user name for the `-user-or-group-name` parameter.
+
The following command creates the backup user `backup_admin1` with the `backup` role for the entire cluster:
+
`cluster1::> security login create -user-or-group-name backup_admin1 -application ssh -authmethod password -role backup`
+
The following command creates the backup user `vsbackup_admin1` with the `vsadmin-backup` role for an individual SVM:
+
`cluster1::> security login create -user-or-group-name vsbackup_admin1 -application ssh -authmethod password -role vsadmin-backup`
+
Enter a password for the new user and confirm.
+
Learn more about `security login create` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/security-login-create.html[ONTAP command reference^].

. Generate a password for the admin SVM by using the `vserver services ndmp generate password` command.
+
The generated password must be used to authenticate the NDMP connection by the backup application.
