You must ensure that tape drives are reserved for use by backup applications for NDMP backup operations.

.About this task

The reservation settings vary in different backup applications, and these settings must match the backup application and the nodes or servers using the same drives. See the vendor documentation of the backup application for the correct reservation settings.

.Steps

. Enable reservations by using the `options -option-name tape.reservations -option-value persistent` command.
+
The following command enables reservations with the `persistent` value:
+
----
cluster1::> options -option-name tape.reservations -option-value persistent
2 entries were modified.
----

. Verify that reservations are enabled on all nodes by using the `options tape.reservations` command, and then review the output.
+
----
cluster1::> options tape.reservations

cluster1-1
    tape.reservations                 persistent

cluster1-2
    tape.reservations                 persistent
2 entries were displayed.
