[.lead]
You can back up volumes hosted on a single node by enabling node-scoped NDMP, enabling the NDMP service, and configuring a LIF for data and control connection. This can be done for all nodes of the cluster.

NOTE: Node-scoped NDMP is deprecated in ONTAP 9.

.About this task

When using NDMP in node-scope mode, authentication must be configured on a per-node basis. For more information, see link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Protection_and_Security/NDMP/How_to_configure_NDMP_authentication_in_the_%E2%80%98node-scope%E2%80%99_mode[the Knowledge Base article "How to configure NDMP authentication in the ‘node-scope’ mode"^].

.Steps

. Enable node-scoped NDMP mode: 
+
[source,cli]
----
cluster1::> system services ndmp node-scope-mode on
----
+
NDMP node-scope-mode is enabled.

. Enable NDMP service on all nodes in the cluster:
+
Using the wildcard "`*`" enables NDMP service on all nodes at the same time.
+
You must specify a password for authentication of the NDMP connection by the backup application.
+
[source,cli]
----
cluster1::> system services ndmp on -node *
----
+
----
Please enter password:
Confirm password:

. Disable the `-clear-text` option for secure communication of the NDMP password:
+
Using the wildcard "`*`" disables the `-clear-text` option on all nodes at the same time.
+
[source,cli]
----
cluster1::> system services ndmp modify -node * -clear-text false
----

. Verify that NDMP service is enabled and the `-clear-text` option is disabled:
+
[source,cli]
----
cluster1::> system services ndmp show
----
+
----
