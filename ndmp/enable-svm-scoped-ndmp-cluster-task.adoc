If the DMA supports the Cluster Aware Backup (CAB) extension, you can back up all the volumes hosted across different nodes in a cluster by enabling SVM-scoped NDMP, enabling NDMP service on the cluster (admin SVM), and configuring LIFs for data and control connection.

.Before you begin

The CAB extension must be supported by the DMA.

.About this task

Turning off node-scoped NDMP mode enables SVM-scoped NDMP mode on the cluster.

.Steps

. Enable SVM-scoped NDMP mode:
+
[source,cli]
+
----
cluster1::> system services ndmp node-scope-mode off
----
+
SVM-scoped NDMP mode is enabled.

. Enable NDMP service on the admin SVM:
+
[source,cli]
----
cluster1::> vserver services ndmp on -vserver cluster1
----
+
The authentication type is set to `challenge` by default and plaintext authentication is disabled.
+
[NOTE]
====
For secure communication, you should keep plaintext authentication disabled.
====

. Verify that NDMP service is enabled:
+
[source,cli]
----
cluster1::> vserver services ndmp show
----
+
----
Vserver       Enabled   Authentication type
------------- --------- -------------------
cluster1      true      challenge
vs1           false     challenge
