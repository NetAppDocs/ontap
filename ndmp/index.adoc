You can quickly configure an ONTAP 9 cluster to use the Network Data Management Protocol (NDMP) to back up data directly to tape using a third-party backup application.

If the backup application supports Cluster Aware Backup (CAB), you can configure NDMP as _SVM-scoped_ or _node-scoped_:

* SVM-scoped at the cluster (admin SVM) level enables you to back up all volumes hosted across different nodes of the cluster. SVM-scoped NDMP is recommended where possible.

* Node-scoped NDMP enables you to back up all the volumes hosted on that node.

If the backup application does not support CAB, you must use node-scoped NDMP.

SVM-scoped and node-scoped NDMP are mutually exclusive; they cannot be configured on the same cluster.

NOTE: Node-scoped NDMP is deprecated in ONTAP 9.

Learn more about link:../tape-backup/cluster-aware-backup-extension-concept.html[Cluster Aware Backup (CAB)].

Before configuring NDMP, verify the following:

* You have a third-party backup application (also called a Data Management Application or DMA).
* You are a cluster administrator.
* Tape devices and an optional media server are installed.
* Tape devices are connected to the cluster through a Fibre Channel (FC) switch or locally attached.
* At least one tape device has a logical unit number (LUN) of 0.
