After the cluster is configured for NDMP access, you must gather information from the cluster configuration and then configure the rest of the backup process in the backup application.

.Steps

. Gather the following information that you configured earlier in ONTAP:
 ** The user name and password that the backup application requires to create the NDMP connection
 ** The IP addresses of the intercluster LIFs that the backup application requires to connect to the cluster
. In ONTAP, display the aliases that ONTAP assigned to each device by using the `storage tape alias show` command.
+
The aliases are often useful in configuring the backup application.

. In the backup application, configure the rest of the backup process by using the backup application's documentation.

.After you finish

If a data mobility event occurs, such as a volume move or LIF migration, you must be prepared to reinitialize any interrupted backup operations.
