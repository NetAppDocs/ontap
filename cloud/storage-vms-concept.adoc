A storage VM (SVM) serves data to clients and hosts. Like a virtual machine running on a hypervisor, an SVM is a logical entity that abstracts physical resources.

In an on-premises ONTAP environment, you use SVMs to separate workloads. In Cloud Volumes ONTAP, you can use multiple SVMs, or you can use multiple instances of Cloud Volumes ONTAP.
