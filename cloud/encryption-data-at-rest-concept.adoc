ONTAP uses the same encryption technology to secure data in the cloud that you use to secure your on-premises data.

Cloud Volumes ONTAP supports NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE) and NetApp Aggregate Encryption (NAE) with an external key manager.

Cloud Volumes ONTAP also supports the following encryption technologies:

* AWS Key Management Service
* Azure Storage Service Encryption
* Google Cloud Platform default encryption

Data is always encrypted at rest when using Azure NetApp Files and NetApp Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud.
