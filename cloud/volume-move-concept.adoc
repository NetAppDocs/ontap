summary: "Using ONTAP, you can move a FlexVol volume to a different local tier (aggregate), node, or both within the same storage VM (SVM) to balance storage capacity after you determine that there is a storage capacity imbalance. With Cloud Volumes ONTAP, you can move one or more volumes to another Cloud Volumes ONTAP system or to another aggregate to avoid capacity issues. You might need to do this if the system reaches its disk limit."

Using ONTAP, you can move a FlexVol volume to a different local tier (aggregate), node, or both within the same storage VM (SVM) to balance storage capacity after you determine that there is a storage capacity imbalance. With Cloud Volumes ONTAP, you can move one or more volumes to another Cloud Volumes ONTAP system or to another aggregate to avoid capacity issues. You might need to do this if the system reaches its disk limit.
