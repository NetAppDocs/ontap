The same storage efficiency features of on-premises ONTAP are available in the Cloud. SnapShot copies, deduplication, compression, compaction, thin provisioning, and FlexClone data clones are all available in NetApp Cloud offerings.

When you move data from on-premises ONTAP to the cloud, the existing storage efficiency is preserved. Whether you are moving an entire dataset, or just tiering cold data to the cloud, you won't move uncompressed or duplicate data.
