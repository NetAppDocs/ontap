Create volumes to provide storage for home directories using the SMB protocol.

This procedure creates new volumes for home directories on an link:task_nas_enable_windows_smb.html[existing SMB-enabled storage VM]. You can accept systems defaults when configuring volumes or specify custom configurations.

image:workflow_nas_provision_home_directories.gif[Workflow summary: 1 Create Volume 2 Create home directory share 3 Verify share access]

You can create FlexVol volumes, or for large file systems with high performance requirements, you can create FlexGroup volumes.  See also link:../flexgroup/provision-nas-flexgroup-task.html[Provision NAS storage for large file systems using FlexGroup volumes].

You can also save the specifications of this volume to an Ansible Playbook. For more details, go to link:task_admin_use_ansible_playbooks_add_edit_volumes_luns.html[Use Ansible Playbooks to add or edit volumes or LUNs].

.Steps

. Add a new volume in an SMB-enabled storage VM.

.. Select *Storage > Volumes* and then click *Add*.

.. Enter a name, select the storage VM, and enter a size.
+
Only storage VMs configured with the SMB protocol are listed. If only one storage VM configured with the SMB protocol is available, the *Storage VM* field is not shown.
+
*** If you click *Save* at this point, System Manager uses system defaults to create and add a FlexVol volume.

*** You can click *More options* to customize the configuration of the volume to enable services such as authorization, quality of service, and data protection.  Refer to <<Customize the volume configuration>>, then return here to complete the following steps.

. [[step2,Step 2 in the workflow]] Click *Storage > Shares*, click *Add*, and select *Home Directory*.

. On a Windows client, do the following to verify that the share is accessible.

.. In Windows Explorer, map a drive to the share in the following format: `\\<SMB_Server_Name>\<Share_Name>`
+
If the share name was created with variables (%w, %d, or %u), be sure to test access with a resolved name.

.. On the newly created drive, create a test file, and then delete the file.
