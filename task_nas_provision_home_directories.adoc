Create volumes to provide storage for home directories using the SMB protocol.

This procedure creates new volumes for home directories on an link:task_nas_enable_windows_smb.html[existing SMB-enabled storage VM]. You can accept systems defaults when configuring volumes or specify custom configurations.

You can create FlexVol volumes, or for large file systems with high performance requirements, you can create FlexGroup volumes.  See also link:task_nas_provision_flexgroup.html[Provision NAS storage for large file systems using FlexGroup volumes].

You can also save the specifications of this volume to an Ansible Playbook. For more details, go to link:task_admin_use_ansible_playbooks_add_edit_volumes_luns.html[Use Ansible Playbooks to add or edit volumes or LUNs].

.Steps

. Add a new volume in an SMB-enabled storage VM.

.. Select *Storage > Volumes* and then click *Add*.

.. Enter a name, select the storage VM, and enter a size.
+
Only storage VMs configured with the SMB protocol are listed. If only one storage VM configured with the SMB protocol is available, the *Storage VM* field is not shown.
+
*** If you click *Save* at this point, System Manager uses system defaults to create and add a FlexVol volume.

*** You can click *More options* to customize the configuration of the volume to enable services such as authorization, quality of service, and data protection.  Refer to <<Customize the volume configuration>>, then return here to complete the following steps.

. [[step2,Step 2 in the workflow]] Click *Storage > Shares*, click *Add*, and select *Home Directory*.

. On a Windows client, do the following to verify that the share is accessible.

.. In Windows Explorer, map a drive to the share in the following format: `\\<SMB_Server_Name>\<Share_Name>`
+
If the share name was created with variables (%w, %d, or %u), be sure to test access with a resolved name.

.. On the newly created drive, create a test file, and then delete the file.
