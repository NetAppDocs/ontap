Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, you can take corrective actions directly from File System Analytics displays based on current data and desired outcomes.

When analytics are enabled, you can take the following actions:

*	Delete directories and files
+
In the Explorer display, you can select directories or individual files to delete. Directories are deleted with low-latency fast directory delete functionality. (Fast directory delete is also available beginning in ONTAP 9.9.1 without analytics enabled.)
*	Assign media cost in storage tiers to compare costs of inactive data storage locations
+
Media cost is a value that you assign based on your evaluation of storage costs, represented as your choice of currency per GB. When set, System Manager uses the assigned media cost to project estimated savings when you move volumes.
+
The media cost you set is not persistent; it can only be set for a single browser session.
*	Move volumes to reduce storage costs
Based on analytics displays and media cost comparisons, you can move volumes to less expensive storage in local tiers.
+
Only one volume at a time can be compared and moved.
