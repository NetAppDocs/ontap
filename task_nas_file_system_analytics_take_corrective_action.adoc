Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, you can take corrective actions based on current data and desired outcomes directly from the File System Analytics displays.

== Delete directories and files

In the Explorer display, you can select directories or individual files to delete. Directories are deleted with low-latency asynchronous directory delete functionality. (Asynchronous directory delete is also available beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1 without analytics enabled.)

== Assign media cost in storage tiers to compare costs of inactive data storage locations

Media cost is a value that you assign based on your evaluation of storage costs, represented as your choice of currency per GB. When set, System Manager uses the assigned media cost to project estimated savings when you move volumes.

The media cost you set is not persistent; it can only be set for a single browser session.

.Steps

. Click *Storage > Tiers*, then click  *Set Media Cost* in the desired local tier (aggregate) tiles.
+
Be sure to select active and inactive tiers to enable comparison.
. Enter a currency type and amount.
+
When you enter or change the media cost, the change is made in all media types.

== Move volumes to reduce storage costs
Based on analytics displays and media cost comparisons, you can move volumes to less expensive storage in local tiers.

Only one volume at a time can be compared and moved.

.Steps

. After enabling media cost display, click *Storage > Tiers*, then click *Volumes*.
. To compare destination options for a volume, click image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon] for the volume, then click *Move*.
. In the *Select Destination Local Tier* display, select destination tiers to display the estimated cost difference.
. After comparing options, select the desired tier and click *Move*.
