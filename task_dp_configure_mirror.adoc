Create a mirror and vault of a volume to protect data in case of a disaster and to have multiple archived versions of data to which you can roll back. Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, you can use System Manager to select pre-created and custom mirror and vault policies, to display and select legacy policies, and to override the transfer schedules defined in a protection policy when protecting volumes and storage VMs. This capability is also available in ONTAP 9.8P12 and later patches of ONTAP 9.8.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using ONTAP 9.8P12 or later ONTAP 9.8 patch release and you configured SnapMirror using System Manager, you should use ONTAP 9.9.1P13 or later and ONTAP 9.10.1P10 or later patch releases if you plan to upgrade to ONTAP 9.9.1 or ONTAP 9.10.1 releases.

This procedure creates a data protection policy on a remote cluster. The source cluster and destination cluster use intercluster network interfaces for exchanging data. The procedure assumes the link:task_dp_prepare_mirror.html[intercluster network interfaces are created and the clusters containing the volumes are peered] (paired). You can also peer storage VMs for data protection; however, if storage VMs are not peered, but permissions are enabled, storage VMs are automatically peered when the protection relationship is created.

.Steps

. Select the volume or LUN to protect: click *Storage > Volumes* or *Storage > LUNs*, and then click the desired volume or LUN name.

. Click image:icon_protect.gif[Protect button].

. Select the destination cluster and storage VM.

. The asynchronous policy is selected by default. To select a synchronous policy, click *More Options*.

. Click *Protect*.

. Click the *SnapMirror (Local or Remote)* tab for the selected volume or LUN to verify that protection is set up correctly.
