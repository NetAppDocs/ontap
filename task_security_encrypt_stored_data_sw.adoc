Use volume encryption to ensure that volume data cannot be read if the underlying device is repurposed, returned, misplaced, or stolen. Volume encryption does not require special disks; it works with all HDDs and SSDs.

.About this task

This procedure applies to FAS, AFF, and current ASA systems. If you have an ASA r2 system (ASA A1K, ASA A70, or ASA A90), follow link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/asa-r2/secure-data/encrypt-data-at-rest.html[these steps^] to enable software level encryption. ASA r2 systems provide a simplified ONTAP experience specific to SAN-only customers.

Volume encryption requires a key manager. You can configure the Onboard Key Manager using System Manager. You can also use an external key manager, but you need to first set it up using the ONTAP CLI.

After the key manager is configured, new volumes are encrypted by default.

.Steps

. Click *Cluster > Settings*.
. Under *Encryption*, click image:icon_gear.gif[Actions icon] to configure the Onboard Key Manager for the first time.
. To encrypt existing volumes, click *Storage > Volumes*.
. On the desired volume, click image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon] and then click *Edit*.
. Select *Enable encryption*.
