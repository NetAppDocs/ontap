NetApp is the data authority for the hybrid cloud. NetApp offers a variety of options for extending on-premises data management systems to the hybrid cloud with Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and other leading cloud providers. NetApp hybrid-cloud solutions support the same Zero Trust security controls that are available with on-premises ONTAP systems and ONTAP Select software-defined storage.

You can easily expand capacity in public clouds without typical capex constraints by using the NetApp Cloud Volumes service, the first enterprise-class, cloud-native file service for AWS and GCP, and Azure NetApp Files for Microsoft Azure. Ideal for data-intensive workloads such as analytics and DevOps, these cloud data services combine elastic, on-demand storage as a service from NetApp with ONTAP data management in a fully managed offering.

For those seeking advanced data services for cloud block or object storage services such as AWS EBS and S3 or Azure storage, Cloud Volumes ONTAP provides data management between your on-premises environment and the public cloud with a single common view. Running in AWS or Azure as an on-demand instance, Cloud Volumes ONTAP provides the storage efficiency, availability, and scalability of ONTAP software. ONTAP enables the movement of data between your on-premises ONTAP systems and AWS or Azure storage environment with NetApp SnapMirror^®^ data replication software.
