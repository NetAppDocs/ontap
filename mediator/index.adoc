= Installation and upgrade of ONTAP Mediator
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

[.lead]
To install or upgrade ONTAP Mediator, meet all prerequisites, download the installation package, and run the installer on the host.

* Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can use any version of ONTAP Mediator to monitor an SnapMirror active sync relationship.
* Beginning with ONTAP 9.7, you can use any version of ONTAP Mediator to monitor a MetroCluster IP configuration.

== Installation and upgrade considerations

Review these points before upgrading or installing ONTAP Mediator. 

NOTE: ONTAP Mediator 1.8 and earlier is not compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) FIPS mode and prevents it from installing successfully. You can check if FIPS mode is enabled using the `fips-mode-setup --check` command. You can disable FIPS mode using the `fips-modesetup --disable` command. Reboot after disabling FIPS mode to successfully install ONTAP Mediator 1.8 or earlier.

* You should upgrade ONTAP Mediator to the latest version. Older versions still work with all ONTAP releases, but newer versions include security patches for third-party components.

* When you upgrade to a new ONTAP Mediator version, the installer automatically upgrades to the recommended SCST version unless a higher version is available. For instructions on manually installing a higher SCST version, see link:manage-task.html[Manage ONTAP Mediator]. For supported versions, see the link:whats-new-concept.html#scst-support-matrix[SCST support matrix].

[NOTE]
====
* If the installation fails, you might need to upgrade to a newer version of ONTAP Mediator. 
* From June 15, 2025, you can't install or upgrade ONTAP Mediator 1.9 and 1.8 because their code signing certificates have expired. If the installation or upgrade fails, use the ONTAP Mediator 1.9.1 patch version instead. 
====

* If you install the `yum-utils` package, you can use the `needs-restarting` command. 

* ONTAP Mediator 1.11 supports IPv6 for MCCIP; 1.10 and earlier versions do not support it.

=== Host requirements 
// BURT 1392725

Follow these requirements when installing RHEL or Rocky Linux and configuring the associated repositories. 

[NOTE] 
====
If you modify the installation or configuration process, you might need to perform additional steps.
====

.Linux distribution requirements
* Install RHEL or Rocky Linux according to Red Hat's best practices. Because CentOS 8.x has reached end-of-life, compatible versions of CentOS 8.x are not recommended.
* When installing ONTAP Mediator, ensure the system has access to the required repository so the installation program can retrieve and install all required software dependencies.
* To enable the yum installer to find dependent software in the RHEL repositories, register the system during installation or afterwards using a valid Red Hat subscription.
+
[NOTE] 
====
See the Red Hat Subscription Manager documentation for further information.
====

.Networking requirements
Ensure that the following ports are available and unused for ONTAP Mediator:

|===

h| Port/services h| Source h| Direction h|  Destination h| Purpose 

a| 
22/tcp
a|
Management host
a|
Inbound
a|
ONTAP Mediator

3260/tcp ^1^
a|
Node Data LIFs or Node Management LIFs
a|
Bidirectional
a|
ONTAP Mediator iSCSI targets
a|
(Required for MCCIP) iSCSI data connection for mailboxes
|===
 
For SMBC customers, ONTAP doesn't require port 3260 to be enabled or connected.

* If using a third-party firewall, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/install-ip/concept_mediator_requirements.html#firewall-requirements-for-ontap-mediator[Firewall requirements for ONTAP Mediator^].
* For Linux hosts without internet access, make sure the required packages are available in a local repository.
+
If you are using Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) in a Linux environment, configure the kernel and set the `sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_ignore` to `2`.

.OS requirements

Your OS must meet the following requirements:

* 64-bit physical installation or virtual machine
* 8 GB RAM
* 1 GB disk space (used for applications installation, server logs, and the database)
* User: Root access

The following table shows the supported OSs for each version of ONTAP Mediator.
include::../_include/mediator-linux-support.adoc[]

.OS required packages

The following packages are required by ONTAP Mediator:

[NOTE] 
The packages are either pre-installed or automatically installed by the ONTAP Mediator installer.

[cols="25,25,25,25"]
|===

h| All RHEL/CentOS versions h| Additional packages for RHEL 10.x / Rocky Linux 10 h| Additional packages for RHEL 9.x / Rocky Linux 9 h| Additional packages for RHEL 8.x / Rocky Linux 8

a|
 * openssl

a|

 * policycoreutils-python-utils
 * redhat-lsb-core
 * python39
 * python39-devel

|===

The Mediator installation package is a self-extracting compressed tar file that includes:

* An RPM file containing all dependencies that cannot be obtained from the supported release's repository.
* An install script.

A valid SSL certificate is recommended.

=== OS upgrade considerations and kernel compatibility
* You can update all library packages except the kernel, but you might need to reboot to apply changes in ONTAP Mediator. Schedule downtime if you need to reboot.
* You should keep the OS kernel up to date. Upgrade the kernel core to a supported version listed in the link:whats-new-concept.html#scst-support-matrix[ONTAP Mediator version matrix]. You must reboot the system, so plan a maintenance window for the outage.
** Uninstall the SCST kernel module before you reboot, and then reinstall it afterwards.
** Prepare a supported version of SCST to reinstall before you start the kernel OS upgrade.


[NOTE] 
====
* The kernel version must match the operating system version.
* Do not upgrade the kernel past the supported OS version for your ONTAP Mediator release as the tested SCST module probably won't work.

== Install ONTAP Mediator when UEFI Secure Boot is enabled

ONTAP Mediator can be installed on a system with or without UEFI Secure Boot enabled.

.About this task

You can choose to disable UEFI Secure Boot before installing ONTAP Mediator if it is not needed or if you are troubleshooting ONTAP Mediator installation issues. Disable the UEFI Secure Boot option from your machine settings. 

[NOTE] 
====
For detailed instructions on disabling UEFI Secure Boot, refer to the documentation for your host OS.
====

To install ONTAP Mediator with UEFI Secure Boot enabled, you must register a security key before the service can start. The key is generated during the SCST installation's compile step and saved as a private-public key pair on your machine. Use the `mokutil` utility to add the public key as a Machine Owner Key (MOK) to your UEFI firmware, enabling the system to trust and load the signed module. Save the `mokutil` passphrase in a secure location as this is required when rebooting your system to activate the MOK.

.Steps

. [[step_1_uefi]]Check if UEFI Secure Boot is enabled on your system:
+
`mokutil --sb-state`
+
The results indicate whether UEFI Secure Boot is enabled on this system. 
+

h| If... h| Go to...

a| UEFI secure boot is enabled
a| <<step_2_uefi,The step where you run the `mokutil` utility>>

a| UEFI secure boot is disabled
a| link:upgrade-host-os-mediator-task.html[Upgrade the host operating system and then ONTAP Mediator]

|===
+
[NOTE] 
====
* You are prompted to create a passphrase that you must store in a secure location. You'll need this passphrase to enable the key in the UEFI Boot Manager.
* ONTAP Mediator 1.2.0 and earlier versions do not support this mode.
====

. [[step_2_uefi]]If the `mokutil` utility is not installed, run the following command: 
+
`yum install mokutil`
