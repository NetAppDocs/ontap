To install the ONTAP Mediator service, you must ensure all prerequisites are met, get the installation package and run the installer on the host. This procedure is used for an installation or an upgrade of an existing installation.

.Before you begin

//ontap-metrocluster/issues/35
You must meet the following prerequisites.

[cols="30,70"]

h| Mediator version h| Supported Linux versions

a|
1.3
a|
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux: 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, 7.9, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3
* CentOS: 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, 7.9

NOTE: The kernel version must match the operating system version.

// BURT 1392725
* 64-bit physical installation or virtual machine
* 8 GB RAM
* User: Root access

== Upgrade the host operating system and then the Mediator

The following table provides the upgrade guidelines if you are upgrading from RHEL/CentOS 7.6 to a later RHEL/CentOS release in addition upgrading the Mediator version.

[cols="20,20,60"]

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux: 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, 8.0, 8.1
* CentOS: 7.6, 7.7, 7.8
a|
1.2
a|

* The upgrade must be performed in the following order:
 .. Upgrade the operating system from RHEL/CentOS version.
 .. Reboot the host to apply the kernel module changes.
 .. Upgrade the Mediator from the immediately prior version to the current version.
* For MetroCluster:
. The storage iscsi-initiator show command will report that the connection to the Mediator service is down during the upgrade.
. The ONTAP operating system will generate the following EMS events:
 .. cf.mccip.med.auso.stDisabled during the upgrade
 .. cf.mccip.med.auso.stEnabled when automatic unplanned switchover is re-enabled

.. Upgrade the operating system from RHEL/CentOS version.
.. Reboot the host to apply the kernel module changes.
.. Upgrade the Mediator from the immediately prior version to the current version.

|===

The best practices for installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS and the associated repositories on your system are listed below. Systems installed or configured differently might require additional steps.

* You must install Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS according to Red Hat best practices. Due to end of life support for CentOS 8.x versions, it is not recommended that you use RHEL or a compatible version of CentOS 7.x.
* While installing the ONTAP Mediator service on Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS, the system must have access to the appropriate repository so that the installation program can access and install all the required software dependencies.
* For the yum installer to find dependent software in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux repositories, you must have registered the system during the Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation or afterwards by using a valid Red Hat subscription.
+
See the Red Hat documentation for information about the Red Hat Subscription Manager.
* The following ports must be unused and available for the Mediator:
 ** 31784
 ** 3260
* If using a third-party firewall: refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/install-ip/concept_mediator_requirements.html#firewall-requirements-for-ontap-mediator[Firewall requirements for ONTAP Mediator^]
* If the Linux host is in a location without access to the internet, you can either install the packages manually or you must ensure that the required packages are available in a local repository.
+
You can use the following link for information about setting up a repository.
+
If you are using Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) in a Linux environment, you must correctly configure the kernel and make sure the `sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_ignore` is set to "2".
+
The following packages are required by the ONTAP Mediator service:
+

[cols="25,35,40"]

h| All RHEL/CentOS versions h| Additional packages for RHEL/CentOS 7.x h| Additional packages for RHEL 8.x

|===

* If signature verification is configured, it must be disabled. This can be done in one of two ways:
 ** If the UEFI SecureBoot mechanism is configured, disable it.
 ** Disable the signature verification mechanism by updating and regenerating the grub.cfg file:
  ... Open the /etc/default/grub file.
  ... Add the string module.sig_enforce=0 to the end of the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX statement.
  ... Regenerate the grub.cfg file to implement the change:
+
`update-bootloader || update-grub || grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg`
  ... Reboot the host.

The Mediator installation package is a self-extracting compressed tar file that includes:

* An RPM file containing all dependencies that cannot be obtained from the supported release's repository.
* An install script.

A valid SSL certification is recommended, as documented in this procedure.

== Enable access to the repositories

|===

h| If your operating system is... h| You must provide access to these repositories...

a|

== Download the Mediator installation package

.Steps

. Download the Mediator installation package from the ONTAP Mediator page.
+
https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/ontap-mediator/downloads-tab[ONTAP Mediator download page^]

. Confirm that the Mediator installation package is in the target directory:
+
`ls`
+
----
[root@mediator-host ~]#ls
./ontap-mediator_1.3
----
+
If you are at a location without access to the internet, you must ensure that the installer has access to the required packages.

. If necessary, move the Mediator installation package from the download directory to the installation directory on the Linux Mediator host.

== Install the ONTAP Mediator installation package

.Step

. Install the Mediator installation package and respond to the prompts as required:
+
`./ontap-mediator_1.3`
+
The installation process proceeds to create the required accounts and install required packages. If you have a previous version of Mediator installed on the host, you will be prompted to confirm that you want to upgrade.

== Verify the installation

.Steps

. Run the following command to view the status of the ONTAP Mediator services:
+
`systemctl`
