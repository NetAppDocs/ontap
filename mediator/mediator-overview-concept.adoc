[.lead]
The ONTAP Mediator provides several functions for ONTAP features:

* Provides a persistent and fenced store for HA metadata.
* Serves as a ping proxy for controller liveliness.
* Provides synchronous node health query functionality to aid in quorum determination.

The ONTAP Mediator provides two additional systemctl services:

* *`ontap_mediator.service`*
+ 
Maintains the REST APIs server for managing the ONAP relationships.

* *`mediator-scst.service`*
+ 
Controls the startup and shutdown of the iSCSI module (SCST).

== Tools provided for the system administrator

Tools provided for the system administrator:

* *`/usr/local/bin/mediator_change_password`*
+
Sets a new API password when the current API username and password are provided.

* *`/usr/local/bin/mediator_change_user`*
+
Sets a new API username when the current API username and password are provided.

* *`/usr/local/bin/mediator_generate_support_bundle`*
+
Generates a local tgz file containing all useful support information needed for communication with NetApp customer support.  This includes application configuration, logs, and some system information.  The bundles are generated on the local disk and can be transferred manually, as needed.  Storage location: /opt/netapp/data/support_bundles/

* *`/usr/local/bin/uninstall_ontap_mediator`*
+
Removes the ONTAP Mediator package and the SCST kernel module. This includes all configuration, logs, and mailbox data.

* *`/usr/local/bin/mediator_unlock_user`*
+
Releases a lock-out on the API user account if the authentication retry limit was reached.  This feature is used to prevent brute force password derivation.  It prompts the user for the correct username and password.

* *`/usr/local/bin/mediator_add_user`*
+
(Support only) Used to add the API user upon installation.


== Special Notes

ONTAP Mediator relies on SCST to provide iSCSI (See http://scst.sourceforge.net/index.html).  This package is a kernel module that is compiled during installation specifically for the kernel. Any updates to the kernel might require SCST to be re-installed.  Alternatively, uninstall then re-install the ONTAP Mediator, then reconfigure the ONTAP relationship.

NOTE: Any updates to the server OS kernel should be coordinated with a maintenance window in ONTAP.
