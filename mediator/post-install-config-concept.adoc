[.lead]
After the ONTAP Mediator service is installed and running, additional configuration tasks must be performed in the ONTAP storage system to use the Mediator features:

* To use the ONTAP Mediator service in a MetroCluster IP configuration, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/install-ip/task_configuring_the_ontap_mediator_service_from_a_metrocluster_ip_configuration.html[Configuring the ONTAP Mediator service from a MetroCluster IP configuration^].
* To use SnapMirror active sync, see link:../snapmirror-active-sync/mediator-install-task.html[Install ONTAP Mediator Service and confirm the ONTAP cluster configuration].

== Configure ONTAP Mediator security policies

The ONTAP Mediator server supports several configurable security settings.  The default values for all settings are provided in a `low_space_threshold_mib: 10` read-only file: 

`/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/server_config/ontap_mediator.user_config.yaml`

All values that are placed in the `ontap_mediator.user_config.yaml` will override the default values and be maintained across all ONTAP Mediator upgrades.

After you modify `ontap_mediator.user_config.yaml`, restart the ONTAP Mediator service:

`systemctl restart ontap_mediator`

== Modify ONTAP Mediator attributes

The ONTAP Mediator attributes described in this section can be modified if required.

NOTE: Other default values in the `ontap_mediator.config.yaml` should not be changed because modified values are not maintained during ONTAP Mediator upgrades. 

You modify ONTAP Mediator attributes by copying the required variables to the `ontap_mediator.user_config.yaml` file to override the default settings.

=== Install third-party SSL certificates  

If you need to replace the default self-signed certificates with third-party SSL certificates, modify certain attributes in the following files: 

* `/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/server_config/ontap_mediator.config.yaml`
* `/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/uwsgi/ontap_mediator.ini`

The variables in these files are used to control the certificate files used by the ONTAP Mediator service.

The default variables listed in the following table are included in the `/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/server_config/ontap_mediator.config.yaml` file.

[cols=2*,options="header"]
|===
| Variable 
| Path 
| `cert_path` | `/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/server_config/ontap_mediator_server.crt` 
| `key_path` | `/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/server_config/ontap_mediator_server.key` 
| `ca_cert_path` | `/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/server_config/ca.crt` 
| `ca_key_path` | `/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/server_config/ca.key` 
| `ca_serial_path` | `/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/server_config/ca.srl` 
| `cert_valid_days` | `1095` 
| `x509_passin_pwd` | `pass:ontap` 
|===

* `cert_valid_days` is used to set the expiration of client certificates. The maximum value is three years (1095 days).
* `x509_passin_pwd` is the passphrase for the signed client certificate.

The default variables listed in the following table are included in the `/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/uwsgi/ontap_mediator.ini` file.

[cols=2*,options="header"]
|===
| Variable 
| Path 
| `mediator_cert` | `/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/server_config/ontap_mediator_server.crt`
| `mediator_key` | `/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/server_config/ontap_mediator_server.key`
| `ca_cert_path` |  `/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/server_config/ca.crt`
|===

If you modify these attributes, restart the ONTAP Mediator service to apply the changes. For detailed instructions on how to replace default certificates with third-party certificates, refer to link:../mediator/manage-task.html#replace-self-signed-certificates-with-trusted-third-party-certificates[Replace self-signed certificates with trusted third party certificates].

=== Password attack protection

The following settings provide protection against brute-force password guessing attacks.

To enable the feature, set a value for the `window_seconds` and the `retry_limit`.

Examples:
--
** Provide a 5-minute window for guesses, and then reset the count to zero failures:
+
`authentication_lock_window_seconds: 300`

** Lock the account if five failures occur within the window timeframe:
+
`authentication_retry_limit: 5`

** Reduce the impact of brute-force password guessing attacks by setting a delay that occurs prior to rejecting each attempt, which slows the attacks.
+
`authentication_failure_delay_seconds: 5`
+
....
authentication_failure_delay_seconds: 0   # seconds (float) to delay failed auth attempts prior to response, 0 = no delay
authentication_lock_window_seconds: null  # seconds (int) since the oldest failure before resetting the retry counter, null = no window
authentication_retry_limit: null          # number of retries to allow before locking API access, null = unlimited
....
-- 

=== Password complexity rules 

The following fields control the password complexity rules of the ONTAP Mediator API user account.

....
password_min_length: 8

password_max_length: 64

password_uppercase_chars: 0    # min. uppercase characters

password_lowercase_chars: 1    # min. lowercase character

password_special_chars: 1      # min. non-letter, non-digit

password_nonletter_chars: 2    # min. non-letter characters (digits, specials, anything)
....

=== Control of free space 

There are settings that control the required free space on the `/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator` disk.

If the space is lower than the set threshold, the service will issue a warning event.

....
low_space_threshold_mib: 10
....

=== Control of reserve log space

The RESERVE_LOG_SPACE is controlled by specific settings. By default, the ONTAP Mediator server installation creates a separate disk space for the logs.  The installer creates a new fixed-size file with a total of 700MB of disk space to be used explicitly for Mediator logging.

To disable this feature and use the default disk space, perform the following steps:

--
. Change the value of RESERVE_LOG_SPACE from 1 to 0 in the following file:
+
`/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/tools/mediator_env`
+
. Restart the Mediator:
+
.. `cat /opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/tools/mediator_env | grep "RESERVE_LOG_SPACE"`
+
....
RESERVE_LOG_SPACE=0
....
+
.. `systemctl restart ontap_mediator`
--

To re-enable the feature, change the value from 0 to 1 and restart the Mediator.

NOTE: Toggling between disk spaces does not purge existing logs.  All previous logs are backed up and then moved to the current disk space after toggling and restarting the Mediator.
