== Manually uninstall SCST to perform host maintenance
To uninstall SCST, you need the SCST tar bundle that is used for the installed version of ONTAP Mediator.

.Steps

. Download the appropriate SCST bundle (as shown in the following table) and untar it.
+
[[scst-bundle-table]]
[cols="50,50"]
|===

h| For this version ...  h| Use this tar bundle...

a| ONTAP Mediator 1.6      a| scst-3.7.0.tar.bz2
a| ONTAP Mediator 1.5      a| scst-3.6.0.tar.bz2
a| ONTAP Mediator 1.4      a| scst-3.6.0.tar.bz2
a| ONTAP Mediator 1.3      a| scst-3.5.0.tar.bz2
a| ONTAP Mediator 1.1      a| scst-3.4.0.tar.bz2
a| ONTAP Mediator 1.0      a| scst-3.3.0.tar.bz2

|===

. Issue the following commands in the "scst" directory:
.. `systemctl stop mediator-scst`
.. `make scstadm_uninstall`
.. `make iscsi_uninstall`
.. `make usr_uninstall`
.. `make scst_uninstall`
.. `depmod`

== Manually install SCST to perform host maintenance
To manually install SCST, you need the SCST tar bundle that is used for the installed version of ONTAP Mediator (see the <<scst-bundle-table,table above>>).

. Issue the following commands in the "scst" directory:
.. `make 2release`
.. `make scst_install`
.. `make usr_install`
.. `make iscsi_install`
.. `make scstadm_install`
.. `depmod`
.. `cp scst/src/certs/scst_module_key.der /opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/SCST_mod_keys/.`
.. `cp scst/src/certs/scst_module_key.der /opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/SCST_mod_keys/.`
.. `patch /etc/init.d/scst < /opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/systemd/scst.patch`

. (Optional) If Secure Boot is enabled, before you reboot, perform the following steps:
.. Determine each file name for "scst_vdisk", "scst", and "iscsi_scst" modules. 
+
....
[root@localhost ~]# modinfo -n scst_vdisk
[root@localhost ~]# modinfo -n scst
[root@localhost ~]# modinfo -n iscst_scst
....

.. Determine the kernel release.
+
....
[root@localhost ~]# uname -r
....

.. Sign each file with the kernel.
+
....
[root@localhost ~]# /usr/src/kernels/<KERNEL-RELEASE>/scripts/sign-file \sha256 \
/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/SCST_mod_keys/scst_module_key.priv \
/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/SCST_mod_keys/scst_module_key.der \
_module-filename_
....

.. Install the correct key with the UEFI firmware.
+ 
Instructions for installing the UEFI key are located at:
+
`/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/SCST_mod_keys/README.module-signing`
+
The generated UEFI key is located at:
+
`/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/SCST_mod_keys/scst_module_key.der`

. Perform a reboot.
+
`reboot`
