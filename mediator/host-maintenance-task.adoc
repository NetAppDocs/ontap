[.lead]
Ensure the host OS for ONTAP Mediator is maintained regularly to achieve optimal performance.

== Reboot the host

Reboot the host only when clusters are healthy. Clusters cannot respond to failures while ONTAP Mediator is offline. Set a time for maintenance before you reboot.

ONTAP Mediator automatically resumes during a reboot and re-enters previously configured relationships with ONTAP clusters.

== Host package updates

Update any library or yum package except the kernel. Reboot the host if required for changes to take effect. Schedule a service window before rebooting the host.

If you install the `yum-utils` package, use the `needs-restarting` command to detect if any package changes require a reboot.

Reboot after updating ONTAP Mediator dependencies because changes do not take immediate effect.

== Host OS minor kernel upgrades

SCST must be compiled for the kernel you are using. To update the OS, you need to schedule time for maintenance.

.Steps
Follow these steps to upgrade the host OS kernel.

NOTE: Before upgrading the kernel, check that the OS and ONTAP Mediator version are compatible. For supported versions, see the link:whats-new-concept.html#os-support-matrix[OS support matrix].

. Stop ONTAP Mediator.
. Uninstall the SCST package, see <<Perform host maintenance>>.  (SCST doesn't provide an upgrade mechanism.)
. Upgrade the OS, and reboot.
. Re-install the SCST package.
. Re-enable ONTAP Mediator.

== Perform host maintenance

Upgrading the VM kernel can cause compatibility issues with SCST modules. Manually uninstall and reinstall SCST.

=== Step 1: Uninstall SCST

To uninstall SCST, use the tar bundle for your ONTAP Mediator version.

.Steps

. Download the appropriate SCST bundle (as shown in the following table) and extract it.

|===

.. Access the open source package from the link:https://scst.sourceforge.net/downloads.html[SCST sourceforge downloads^].
.. Select *Download released versions*.
.. Extract the bundle to your VM.

. Run the following uninstall commands in the `scst` directory:
.. `systemctl stop mediator-scst`
.. `make scstadm_uninstall`
.. `make iscsi_uninstall`
.. `make usr_uninstall`
.. `make scst_uninstall`
.. `depmod`

=== Step 2: Install SCST

To manually install SCST, you need the SCST tar bundle that is used for the installed version of ONTAP Mediator (see the <<scst-bundle-table,SCST table>>).

NOTE: Perform this step before you install the ONTAP Mediator. If the SCST version you're using is newer than the version bundled with the ONTAP Mediator installer, the installer skips this step.

. Run the following install commands in the `scst` directory:
.. `make 2release`
.. `make scst_install`
.. `make usr_install`
.. `make iscsi_install`
.. `make scstadm_install`
.. `depmod`
+
[NOTE]
====
If you're performing a first-time installation and want to pre-install ONTAP Mediator, run the following command before continuing with the next step: 

`mkdir -p /opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/SCST_mod_keys`
====

.. `cp scst/src/certs/scst_module_key.der /opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/SCST_mod_keys/` 
.. `patch /etc/init.d/scst < /opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/systemd/scst.patch`
+
NOTE: If you pre-install SCST before ONTAP Mediator during a first-time installation, skip this step. The installer applies relevant SCST patches.

. Optionally, if Secure Boot is enabled, before you reboot, perform the following steps:
.. Determine each file name for the `scst_vdisk`, `scst`, and `iscsi_scst` modules:
+
....
[root@localhost ~]# modinfo -n scst_vdisk
[root@localhost ~]# modinfo -n scst
[root@localhost ~]# modinfo -n iscsi_scst
....

.. Determine the kernel release:
+
....
[root@localhost ~]# uname -r
....

.. Sign each module file with the kernel:
+
....
[root@localhost ~]# /usr/src/kernels/<KERNEL-RELEASE>/scripts/sign-file \sha256 \
/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/SCST_mod_keys/scst_module_key.priv \
/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/SCST_mod_keys/scst_module_key.der \
_module-filename_
....

.. Install the UEFI key with the firmware.
+ 
Instructions for installing the UEFI key are located at:
+
`/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/SCST_mod_keys/README.module-signing`
+
The generated UEFI key is located at:
+
`/opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator/ontap_mediator/SCST_mod_keys/scst_module_key.der`

. Reboot the system:
+
`reboot`

== Host changes to the hostname or IP

.About this task

* Perform this task on the Linux host where you installed ONTAP Mediator.
* Do this only if the self-signed certificates are no longer valid because the hostname or IP address changes after you install ONTAP Mediator.
* After the temporary self-signed certificate has been replaced by a trusted third-party certificate, you do _not_ use this task to regenerate a certificate.  If you do not have a self-signed certificate, you cannot use this procedure.

.Step

Create a temporary self-signed certificate for the current host:

. Restart ONTAP Mediator:
+
`./make_self_signed_certs.sh overwrite`
