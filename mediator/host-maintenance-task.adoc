= Maintain OS host for ONTAP Mediator

[.lead]
For optimal performance, you should maintain the host OS for ONTAP Mediator on a regular basis.

== Reboot the host

Reboot the host when the clusters are healthy.  While the ONTAP Mediator is offline, the clusters are at risk of not being able to react properly to failures. A service window is recommended if a reboot is required.

ONTAP Mediator will automatically resume during a reboot and will re-enter the relationships that were previously configured with ONTAP clusters.

== Host package updates

Any library or yum packages (except the kernel) can be safely updated but might require a reboot to take effect.   A service window is recommended if a reboot is required.

If you install the `yum-utils` package, use the `needs-restarting` command to detect if any package changes require a reboot.

You should reboot if any of the ONTAP Mediator dependencies are updated because they will not take immediate effect on running processes.

== Host OS minor kernel upgrades

SCST must be compiled for the kernel that is being used.  To update the OS, a maintenance window is required.  

.Steps
Perform the following steps to upgrade the host OS kernel.

. Stop the ONTAP Mediator
. Uninstall the SCST package.  (SCST doesn't provide an upgrade mechanism.)
. Upgrade the OS, and reboot.
. Re-install the SCST package.
. Re-enable the ONTAP Mediator services.
