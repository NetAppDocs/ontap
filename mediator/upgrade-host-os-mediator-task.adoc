= Upgrade the host OS and ONTAP Mediator
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

[.lead]
To upgrade the host OS for ONTAP Mediator to a later version, you must first uninstall ONTAP Mediator.

.About this task

When you upgrade the host OS for ONTAP Mediator to a later major version (for example, from 7.x to 8.x) using the leapp-upgrade tool, you must uninstall ONTAP Mediator because the tool tries to detect new versions of any RPMs that are installed in the repositories that are registered with the system. 

Because an .rpm file was installed as part of the ONTAP Mediator installer, it is included in that search. However, because that .rpm file was unpacked as part of the installer and not downloaded from a registered repository, an upgrade cannot be found. In this case, the leapp-upgrade tool uninstalls the package.

In order to preserve the log files, which will be used to triage support cases, you should back up the files before you upgrade the OS and restore them after a reinstall of the ONTAP Mediator package. ONTAP clusters that are connected to it will need to be reconnected after the ONTAP Mediator installation.

NOTE: The following steps should be performed in order. Immediately after you reinstall ONTAP Mediator, you should stop ontap_mediator, replace the log files, and restart it. This is to ensure that logs are not lost.

.Steps

. Back up the log files.

....
[rootmediator-host ~]# tar -czf ontap_mediator_file_backup.tgz -C /opt/netapp/lib/ontap_mediator ./log ./ontap_mediator/server_config/ontap_mediator.user_config.yaml
[rootmediator-host ~]# tar -tf ontap_mediator_file_backup.tgz

./log/ontap_mediator_syslog.log
./ontap_mediator/server_config/ontap_mediator.user_config.yaml
[rootmediator-host ~]#
....

. Perform upgrade with leapp-upgrade tool.

....
[rootmediator-host ~]# leapp preupgrade --target 8.4
  ..<snip upgrade checks>..

  ..<snip upgrade>..
[rootmediator-host ~]# cat /etc/os-release | head -2
NAME="Red Hat Enterprise Linux"
VERSION="8.4 (Ootpa)"
[rootmediator-host ~]#
....

. Reinstall ONTAP Mediator.
+
NOTE: Perform the rest of the steps immediately after reinstalling ONTAP Mediator to prevent a loss of log files.

====

For SnapMirror active sync, if you installed your TLS certificate outside of the /opt/netapp directory, then you will not need to reinstall it. If you were using the default generated self-signed certificate or put your custom certificate in the /opt/netapp directory, then you should back it up and restore it.
