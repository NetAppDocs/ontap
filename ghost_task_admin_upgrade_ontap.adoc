This topic provides a high-level overview of the process for upgrading an ONTAP cluster from ONTAP 9.7 or higher to a later version of ONTAP 9 using the System Manager interface.

If you need information about any other ONTAP cluster upgrade scenario, go link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/upgrade/index.html[here].

You can nondisruptively update the version of ONTAP on your cluster.

Take a look at the simplified ONTAP upgrade capabilities available in ONTAP 9.8 System Manager.

The update process checks your hardware platform and configuration to verify that your system is supported by the ONTAP version to which you are upgrading. ONTAP automatically shifts workloads during an upgrade between clusters so you can continue serving data.

This procedure updates your system to the specified version of ONTAP. It is assumed that your hardware platform and configuration is supported for the target release.
