If you have accidently deleted one or more FlexVol volumes, you can use System Manager to recover these volumes. Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can also user System Manager to recover FlexGroup volumes. You can also delete the volumes permanently by purging the volumes.

The volume retention time can be set on a storage VM level. By default, the volume retention time is set to 12 hours.

== Selecting deleted volumes

.Steps

. Click *Storage > Volumes*.
. Click *More > Show Deleted Volumes*.
. Select the volumes and click the desired action to recover or permanently delete the volumes.

.Steps

. Rename the volume.
. Set up a junction path (NAS).
. Create mappings for LUNs in the volume (SAN).
. Associate a snapshot policy and export policy with the volume.
. Add new quota policy rules for the volume.
. Add a QOS policy for the volume.
