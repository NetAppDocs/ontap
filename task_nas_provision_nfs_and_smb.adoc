Create volumes to provide storage for clients using either the NFS or SMB protocol.

This procedure creates new volumes on an link:task_nas_enable_nfs_and_smb.html[existing storage VM enabled for both NFS and SMB protocols].

image:workflow_provision_multi_nas.gif[Workflow diagram for task to provision nas storage for both Windows and Linux using both NFS and SMB]

You can create FlexVol volumes, or for large file systems with high performance requirements, you can create FlexGroup volumes.  See also link:task_nas_provision_flexgroup.html[Provision NAS storage for large file systems using FlexGroup volumes].

You can also save the specifications of this volume to an Ansible Playbook. For more details, go to link:task_admin_use_ansible_playbooks_add_edit_volumes_luns.html[Use Ansible Playbooks to add or edit volumes or LUNs].

.Steps

. Add a new volume in a storage VM enabled for both NFS and SMB.

.. Click *Storage > Volumes* and then click *Add*.

.. Enter a name, select the storage VM, and enter a size. 
+
Only storage VMs configured with both the NFS and SMB protocols are listed. If only one storage VM configured with the NFS and SMB protocols is available, the *Storage VM* field is not shown.

.. Click *More Options* and select *Export via NFS*.
+
The default setting grants full access to all users. You can add more restrictive rules to the export policy later.

.. Select *Share via SMB/CIFS*.
+
The share is created with a default Access Control List (ACL) set to "Full Control" for the *Everyone* group. You can add restrictions to the ACL later.

.. If you click *Save* at this point, System Manager uses system defaults to create and add a FlexVol volume.

+
Alternatively, you can continue to enable any additional required services such as authorization, quality of service, and data protection. Refer to <<Customize the volume configuration>>, then return here to complete the following steps.

. [[step2-compl-prov-nfs-smb,Step 2 in the workflow]] On a Linux client, verify that the export is accessible.

.. Create and mount the volume using the network interface of the storage VM.

.. On the newly mounted volume, create a test file, write text to it, and then delete the file.

. On a Windows client, do the following to verify that the share is accessible.

.. In Windows Explorer, map a drive to the share in the following format: `+\\_SMB_Server_Name__Share_Name_+`

.. On the newly created drive, create a test file, write text to it, and then delete the file.

+
After verifying access, you can link:task_nas_provision_export_policies.html[restrict client access with the volume’s export policy, restrict client access with the share ACL], and set any desired ownership and permissions on the exported and shared volume.

== Customize the volume configuration

After you save the volume, return to <<step2-compl-prov-nfs-smb>> to complete multiprotocol provisioning for Windows and Linux servers.
