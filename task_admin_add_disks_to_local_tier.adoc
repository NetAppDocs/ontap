You can increase the size of an existing aggregate (local tier) by adding capacity disks.

The process you used to increase capacity depends on the version of ONTAP that you have installed:

|===

h| If you have installed...  h| Then increase capacity with this process...

a| ONTAP 9.7 or earlier
a| <<increase-cap-97-earlier,Increase the capacity of an aggregate (ONTAP 9.7 or earlier)>>

a| ONTAP 9.8 or later
a| <<increase-cap-98-later,Increase the capacity of a local tier (ONTAP 9.8 or later)>>

|===

[[increase-cap-97-earlier]]
== Increase the capacity of an aggregate (ONTAP 9.7 or earlier)

Using System Manager with ONTAP 9.7 or earlier, you can add capacity to an aggregate by adding capacity disks.

.About this task

You perform this task only if you have installed ONTAP 9.7 or earlier. If you installed ONTAP 9.8 or later, refer to <<increase-cap-98-later,Increase the capacity of a local tier (ONTAP 9.8 or later)>>.

.Steps

.	Click *(Return to classic version)*.

.	Click *Hardware and Diagnostics > Aggregates*.

.	Select the aggregate to which you want to add capacity disks, and then click *Actions > Add Capacity*.
+
NOTE: You should add disks that are of the same size as the other disks in the aggregate.

.	Click *Switch to the new experience*.

.	Click *Storage > Tiers* to verify the size of the new aggregate.

[[increase-ca-98-later]]
== Increase the capacity of a local tier (ONTAP 9.8 or later)

Using System manager with ONTAP 9.8 or later, you can add capacity to a local tier by adding capacity disks.

.About this task

You perform this task only if you have installed ONTAP 9.8 or later.  If you installed an earlier version of ONTAP, refer to <<increase-cap-97-earlier,Increase the capacity of an aggregate (ONTAP 9.7 or earlier)>>.

.Steps

. Click *Storage > Tiers*.

. Click image:icon_kabob.gif[kebab icon] next to the name of the local tier to which you want to add capacity.

. Click *Add Capacity*.
+
NOTE: If there are no spare disks that you can add, then the *Add Capacity* option is not shown, and you cannot increase the capacity of the local tier.

. If the node contains multiple storage tiers, then select the number of disks you want to add to the local tier.  Otherwise, if the node contains only a single storage tier, the added capacity is estimated automatically.

. Click *Add*.

. (Optional) The process takes some time to complete. If you want to run the process in the background, select *Run in Background*.

. After the process completes, you can view the increased capacity amount in the local tier information at *Storage > Tiers*.
