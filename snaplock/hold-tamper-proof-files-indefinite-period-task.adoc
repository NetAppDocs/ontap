* You must have logged in on a secure connection (SSH, console, or ZAPI).

.About this task

A file under a Legal Hold behaves like a WORM file with an indefinite retention period. It is your responsibility to specify when the Legal Hold period ends.

The number of files you can place under a Legal Hold depends on the space available on the volume.

.Steps

. Start a Legal Hold:
+
`snaplock legal-hold begin -litigation-name <litigation_name> -volume <volume_name> -path <path_name>`
+
The following command starts a Legal Hold for all the files in `vol1`:
+
----
cluster1::>snaplock legal-hold begin -litigation-name litigation1 -volume vol1 -path /
----

. End a Legal Hold:
+
`snaplock legal-hold end -litigation-name <litigation_name> -volume <volume_name> -path <path_name>`
+
The following command ends a Legal Hold for all the files in `vol1`:
+
----
cluster1::>snaplock legal-hold end -litigation-name litigation1 -volume vol1 -path /
