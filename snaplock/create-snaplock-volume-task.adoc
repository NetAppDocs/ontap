You must create a SnapLock volume for the files or Snapshot copies that you want to commit to the WORM state. Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, any volume you create, regardless of the aggregate type, is created by default as a non-SnapLock volume. You must use the `-snaplock-type` option to explicitly create a SnapLock volume by specifying either Compliance or Enterprise as the SnapLock type. By default, the SnapLock type is set to `non-snaplock`.

.Before you begin

* The SnapLock aggregate must be online.
* You should https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/manage-license-task.html[verify that a SnapLock license is installed]. If a SnapLock license is not installed on the node, you must https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/install-license-task.html[install] it. This license is included with https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/manage-licenses-concept.html[ONTAP One]. Prior to ONTAP One, the SnapLock license was included in the Security and Compliance bundle. The Security and Compliance bundle is no longer offered but is still valid. Although not currently required, existing customers can choose to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/download-nlf-task.html[upgrade to ONTAP One].
* link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/snaplock/initialize-complianceclock-task.html[The Compliance Clock on the node must be initialized].

.About this task

With the proper SnapLock permissions, you can destroy or rename an Enterprise volume at any time. You cannot destroy a Compliance volume until the retention period has elapsed. You can never rename a Compliance volume.

You can clone SnapLock volumes, but you cannot clone files on a SnapLock volume. The clone volume will be of the same SnapLock type as the parent volume.

[NOTE]
====
LUNs are not supported in SnapLock volumes. LUNs are supported in SnapLock volumes only in scenarios where Snapshot copies created on a non-SnapLock volume are transferred to a SnapLock volume for protection as part of SnapLock vault relationship. LUNs are not supported in read/write SnapLock volumes. Tamperproof Snapshot copies however are supported on both SnapMirror source volumes and destination volumes that contain LUNs.
====

Perform this task using ONTAP System Manager or the ONTAP CLI.

[role="tabbed-block"]
====
.System Manager
--
Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, you can use System Manager to create a SnapLock volume.

.Steps

. Navigate to *Storage > Volumes* and click *Add*.
. In the *Add Volume* window, click *More Options*.
. Enter the new volume information, including the name and size of the volume.
. Select *Enable SnapLock* and choose the SnapLock type, either Compliance or Enterprise.
. In the *Auto-Commit Files* section, select *Modified* and enter the amount of time a file should remain unchanged before it is automatically committed. The minimum value is 5 minutes and the maximum value is 10 years.
. In the *Data Retention* section, select the minimum and maximum retention period.
. Select the default retention period.
. Click *Save*.
. Select the new volume in the *Volumes* page to verify the SnapLock settings.

.CLI
--
. Create a SnapLock volume:
+
[source,cli]
----
volume create -vserver <SVM_name> -volume <volume_name> -aggregate <aggregate_name> -snaplock-type <compliance|enterprise>
----
+
For a complete list of options, see the man page for the command. The following options are not available for SnapLock volumes: `-nvfail`, `-atime-update`, `-is-autobalance-eligible`, `-space-mgmt-try-first`, and `vmalign`.
+
The following command creates a SnapLock `Compliance` volume named `vol1` on `aggr1` on `vs1`:
+
----
cluster1::> volume create -vserver vs1 -volume vol1 -aggregate aggr1 -snaplock-type compliance

== Mount a SnapLock volume

You can mount a SnapLock volume to a junction path in the SVM namespace for NAS client access.

.What you'll need

The SnapLock volume must be online.

.About this task

* You can mount a SnapLock volume only under the root of the SVM.
* You cannot mount a regular volume under a SnapLock volume.

.Steps

. Mount a SnapLock volume:
+
`*volume mount -vserver _SVM_name_ -volume _volume_name_ -junction-path _path_*`
+
For a complete list of options, see the man page for the command.
+
The following command mounts a SnapLock volume named `vol1` to the junction path `/sales` in the `vs1` namespace:
+
----
cluster1::> volume mount -vserver vs1 -volume vol1 -junction-path /sales
