You can delete Enterprise-mode WORM files during the retention period using the privileged delete feature. 
Before you can use this feature, you must create a SnapLock administrator account and then using the account, enable the feature. 

== Create a SnapLock administrator account

You must have SnapLock administrator privileges to perform a privileged delete. These privileges are defined in the vsadmin-snaplock role. If you have not already been assigned that role, you can ask your cluster administrator to create an SVM administrator account with the SnapLock administrator role.

.What you'll need

* You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.
* You must have logged in on a secure connection (SSH, console, or ZAPI).

.Steps

. Create an SVM administrator account with the SnapLock administrator role:
+
`*security login create -vserver _SVM_name_ -user-or-group-name _user_or_group_name_ -application _application_ -authmethod _authentication_method_ -role _role_ -comment _comment_*`
+
The following command enables the SVM administrator account `SnapLockAdmin` with the predefined `vsadmin-snaplock` role to access `SVM1` using a password:
+
----
cluster1::> security login create -vserver SVM1 -user-or-group-name SnapLockAdmin -application ssh -authmethod password -role vsadmin-snaplock
----

== Enable the privileged delete feature

You must explicitly enable the privileged delete feature on the Enterprise volume that contains the WORM files you want to delete.

.About this task

The value of the `-privileged-delete` option determines whether privileged delete is enabled. Possible values are `enabled`, `disabled`, and `permanently-disabled`.

[NOTE]
====
`permanently-disabled` is the terminal state. You cannot enable privileged delete on the volume after you set the state to `permanently-disabled`.
====

.Steps

. Enable privileged delete for a SnapLock Enterprise volume:
+
`*volume snaplock modify -vserver _SVM_name_ -volume _volume_name_ -privileged-delete disabled|enabled|permanently-disabled*`
+
The following command enables the privileged delete feature for the Enterprise volume `dataVol` on `SVM1`:
+
----
SVM1::> volume snaplock modify -vserver SVM1 -volume dataVol -privileged-delete enabled
----

== Delete Enterprise-mode WORM files

You can use the privileged delete feature to delete Enterprise-mode WORM files during the retention period.

.What you'll need

* You must be a SnapLock administrator to perform this task.
* You must have created a SnapLock audit log and enabled the privileged delete feature on the Enterprise volume.

.About this task

You cannot use a privileged delete operation to delete an expired WORM file. You can use the `volume file retention show` command to view the retention time of the WORM file that you want to delete. 
Learn more about `volume file retention show` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/volume-file-retention-show.html[ONTAP command reference^].

.Step

. Delete a WORM file on an Enterprise volume:
+
`*volume file privileged-delete -vserver _SVM_name_ -file _file_path_*`
+
The following command deletes the file `/vol/dataVol/f1` on the SVM``SVM1``:
+
----
SVM1::> volume file privileged-delete -file /vol/dataVol/f1
