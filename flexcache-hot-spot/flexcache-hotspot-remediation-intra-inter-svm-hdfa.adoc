After you determine the density of your HDFs, decide whether you will be accessing the HDFs using NFS and learn about inter-SVM HDFAs and intra-SVM HDFAs options.

TIP: If only SMB clients will be accessing the HDFs, you should create all HDFs in a single SVM. Refer to Windows client configuration to see how to use DFS targets for load balancing.

== Inter-SVM HDFA deployment 
An inter-SVM HDFA requires an SVM be created for each HDF in the HDFA. This allows all HDFs within the HDFA to have the same junction-path, allowing for easier configuration on the client side. 

In the Figure 1 example, each HDF is in its own SVM. This is an inter-SVM HDFA deployment. Each HDF has a junction-path of /hotspots. Also, every IP has a DNS A record of hostname cache. This configuration leverages DNS round-robin to load balance mounts across the different HDFs.

== Intra-SVM HDFA deployment
An intra-SVM requires each HDF to have a unique junction-path, but all HDFs are in one SVM. This setup is easier in ONTAP because it requires only one SVM, but it needs more advanced configuration on the Linux side with `autofs` and data LIF placement in ONTAP.

In the Figure 2 example, every HDF is in the same SVM. This is an intra-SVM HDFA deployment and requires the junction-paths to be unique. To make load balancing work appropriately, you'll need to create a unique DNS name for each IP and place the data LIFs the hostname resolves to only on the nodes where the HDF resides. You'll also need to configure `autofs` with multiple entries as covered in link:flexcache-hotspot-remediation-client-config.html[Linux client configuration].

.What's next
Now that you have an idea of how you want to deploy your HDFAs, deploy the HDFA and configure the clients to access them in a distributed fashion.
