[.lead]
Your first hotspot remediation design decision is to figure out FlexCache density. The following examples are four-node clusters. Assume that the file count is evenly distributed among all the constituents in each HDF. Assume also an even distribution of frontend NAS connections across all nodes.

Although these examples aren't the only configurations you can use, you should understand the guiding design principle to make as many HDFs as your space requirements and available resources allow. 

NOTE: HDFAs are represented using the following syntax: `HDFs per HDFA x nodes per HDF x constituents per node per HDF`

== Example of an 2x2x2 HDFA configuration
Figure 1 is a 2x2x2 HDFA configuration: two HDFs, each spanning two nodes, and each node containing two constituent volumes. In this example, each client has a 50% chance of having direct access to the hot file. Two of the four clients have east-west traffic. Importantly, there are now two HDFs, which means two distinct caches of the hot file. There are now two CPUs/volume affinities servicing access to the hot file.

== Example of an 4x1x4 HDFA configuration
Figure 2 represents an optimal configuration. It is a 4x1x4 HDFA configuration: four HDFs, each contained to a single node, and each node containing four constituents. In this example, each client is guaranteed to have direct access to a cache of the hot file. Since there are four cached files on four different nodes, four different CPUs/volume affinities help service access to the hot file. Additionally, there is zero east-west traffic generated.

.What's next
After you decide how dense you want to make your HDFs, you must make another design decision if you will be accessing the HDFs with NFS with link:flexcache-hotspot-remediation-intra-inter-svm-hdfa.html[inter-SVM HDFAs and intra-SVM HDFAs].
