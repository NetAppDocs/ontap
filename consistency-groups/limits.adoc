[.lead]
When planning and managing your consistency groups, account for object limits at the scope of both the cluster and the parent or child consistency group. 

== Enforced limits

The following table captures limits for consistency groups. Separate limits apply for consistency groups using SnapMirror Business Continuity (SM-BC). For more information, see link:../smbc/considerations-limits.html[SM-BC restrictions and limitations for limits].

|===
h| Limit h| Scope h| Minimum h| Maximum
| Number of consistency groups | Cluster | 0 | Same as maximum volume count in cluster*
| Number of parent consistency groups | Cluster | 0 | Same as maximum volume count in cluster
| Number of individual and parent consistency groups | Cluster | 0 | Same as maximum volume count in cluster
| Number of volumes in a consistency group | Single consistency group | 1 volume | 80 volumes
| Number of volumes in a consistency group with SnapMirror asynchronous | Single consistency group | 1 volume 
a| 
* In ONTAP 9.15.1 and later: 80 volumes
* In ONTAP 9.13.1 and 9.14.1: 16 volumes
| Number of volumes in the child of a parent consistency group | Parent consistency group | 1 volume  | 80 volumes 
| Number of volumes in a child consistency group | Child consistency group | 1 volume | 80 volumes 
| Number of child consistency groups in a parent consistency group | Parent consistency group | 1 consistency group | 5 consistency groups
| Number of SVM disaster recovery relationships where a consistency group exists (available beginning ONTAP 9.14.1) | Cluster | 0 | 32
|===

{asterisk} A maximum of 50 consistency groups enabled with SnapMirror asynchronous can be hosted on a cluster.
