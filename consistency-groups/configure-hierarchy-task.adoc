If your application workload spans more than 80 volumes, ONTAP allows your to create a hierarchical consistency group. Hierarchical consistency groups have a parent that can include up to five individual consistency groups. Hierarchical consistency groups can support different local Snapshot policies across consistency groups or individual volumes. If you use a remote SM-BC policy, that will apply for the entire consistency group. 

For object limits on consistency groups, see xref:index.adoc#consistency-group-object-limits[Object limits for consistency groups].

== Create a hierarchical consistency group with new volumes

.Steps
. Select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select *+Add.* then *Using New LUNs*.
. Name the consistency group. Designate the number of LUNs and capacity per LUN.
. Select the host operating system and LUN format. Enter the host initiator information.
. To configure protection policies, add a child consistency group, or show more options about host initiators, select *More options*.
. To add a child consistency group, select *+Add child consistency group*.
. Select the performance level, the number of LUNs, and capacity per LUN. Designate the host operating system, LUN format, and select a new or existing host initiator group.
. *Optional*: select a local snapshot policy.
. Repeat for up to five child consistency groups.
. Select *Save*.
. Confirm your consistency group has been created by returning to the main consistency group menu where it will appear once the ONTAP job completes. If you set a protection policy, look under the appropriate policy, remote or local, which should display a green shield with a checkmark in it.

== Create a hierarchical consistency group with existing volumes
.Steps
. Select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select *+Add.* then *Using existing volumes*.
. Select the storage VM.
. Select the existing volumes to include. Only volumes that are not already part of a consistency group will be available for selection.
. To add a child consistency group, select *+Add Child Consistency Group*. Create the necessary consistency groups, which will be named automatically.
. Assign existing volumes to each consistency group.
. *Optional*: select a local Snapshot policy. 
. Repeat for up to five child consistency groups.
. Select *Save*.
. Confirm your consistency group has been created by returning to the main consistency group menu where it will appear once the ONTAP job completes. If you have chosen a protection policy, confirm it was properly set by selecting your consistency group from the menu. If you set a protection policy, look under the appropriate policy, remote or local, which should display a green shield with a checkmark in it.
