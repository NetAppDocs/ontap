Beginning in ONTAP 9.12.1, you can modify a consistency group in System Manager by removing volumes or adding existing volumes (expanding the consistency group).

== Add volumes to a consistency group

.Considerations
* When expanding a consistency group, you cannot add volumes associated with another consistency group.
* Consistency groups support NAS, SAN, and NVMe protocols. For more information about consistency groups, refer to the xref:index.html[Consistency groups overview].
* You can add up to 16 volumes at a time to a consistency group, provided that adjustments are within the overall xref:index.html#consistency-group-object-limits[consistency group object limits].
* You cannot add volumes to a consistency group in a SnapMirror Business Continuity (SM-BC) relationship. You must first break the SM-BC relationship to modify the consistency group.
* The ONTAP REST API supports adding _new_ or existing volumes to a consistency group. For more information about the ONTAP REST API, refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-automation/reference/api_reference.html#access-a-copy-of-the-ontap-rest-api-reference-documentation[ONTAP REST API reference documentation^]. 
* When expanding a consistency group, Snapshot copies of the consistency group captured before the expand operation will be considered partial. Any restore operation based on that snapshot copy will reflect the consistency group at the point-in-time of the snapshot.
* If you are using ONTAP 9.10.1 through 9.11.1, you cannot modify a consistency group. To change the configuration of a consistency group in ONTAP 9.10.1 or 9.11.1, you must delete the consistency group and create a new consistency group with new member volumes. 

.Steps
. Select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select the consistency group that you want to modify.
. If you are modifying a single consistency group, at the top of the *Volumes* menu, select *More* and then *Expand* to add a volume.
+
If you are modifying a child consistency group, identify the parent consistency group you want to modify. Select the *>* button to view the child consistency groups, then select image:../media/icon_kabob.gif[three vertically stacked dots] next to the name of the child consistency group you want to modify. From that menu, select *Expand*.
. Select the volumes you want to add to the consistency group. You can add up to 16 volumes at a time.
. Select *Save*. When the operation completes, you can view the newly added volumes in the consistency group's *Volumes* menu. 

== Remove volumes from a consistency group

Volumes removed from a consistency group will no longer exist in the consistency group, but will not be deleted; they will still exist in the cluster. 

.Considerations
* You cannot remove volumes from a consistency group in a SnapMirror Business Continuity (SM-BC) relationship. You must first break the SM-BC relationship to modify the consistency group.
* If a consistency group has no volumes in it following the remove operation, the consistency group will be deleted.
* When a volume is removed from a consistency group, existing Snapshots of the consistency group remain but are invalid and cannot be used to restore the contents of the consistency group. Volume-granular Snapshots remain valid. 
* If you delete a volume from the cluster, it is automatically removed from the consistency group. 
* If you are using ONTAP 9.10.1 or 9.11.1, you can only remove volumes from a consistency group by deleting the volume from the cluster. To change the configuration of a consistency group in ONTAP 9.10.1 or 9.11.1, you must delete the consistency group and create a new consistency group with the desire member volumes. 

.Steps
. Select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select the single or child consistency group that you want to modify. 
. In the *Volumes* menu, select the checkboxes next to the individual volumes you want to remove from the consistency group. 
. Select *Remove volumes from the consistency group*.
. Confirm that you understand removing the volumes will cause all Snapshot copies of the consistency group to become invalid and select *Remove*.
