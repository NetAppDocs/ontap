= Modify member volumes in a consistency group
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, you can modify a consistency group by removing volumes or adding volumes (expanding the consistency group). Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, you can move volumes between child consistency groups if they share a common parent.

== Add volumes to a consistency group

Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, you can non-disruptively add volumes to a consistency group. 

.About this task
* You cannot add volumes associated with another consistency group.
* Consistency groups support NAS, SAN, and NVMe protocols.
* You can add up to 16 volumes at a time to a consistency group if the adjustments are within the overall xref:limits.html[consistency group limits].
* Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, you can non-disruptively add volumes to a consistency group with an active SnapMirror Business Continuity (SM-BC) or asynchronous SnapMirror protection policy.
    * When you add volumes to a consistency group protected by SM-BC, the status of the SM-BC relationship status will change to "Expanding" until mirroring and protection are configured for the new volume. If a disaster occurs on the primary cluster before this process completes, the consistency group reverts back to its original composition as part of the failover operation.
* In ONTAP 9.12.1 and earlier, you _cannot_ add volumes to a consistency group in an SM-BC relationship. You must first break the SM-BC relationship, modify the consistency group, then restore protection with SM-BC.
* Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, the ONTAP REST API supports adding _new_ or existing volumes to a consistency group. For more information about the ONTAP REST API, refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-automation/reference/api_reference.html#access-a-copy-of-the-ontap-rest-api-reference-documentation[ONTAP REST API reference documentation^]. 
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, this functionality is supported in System Manager.
* When expanding a consistency group, Snapshot copies of the consistency group captured before the modification will be considered partial. Any restore operation based on that Snapshot copy will reflect the consistency group at the point-in-time of the snapshot.
* If you are using ONTAP 9.10.1 through 9.11.1, you cannot modify a consistency group. To change the configuration of a consistency group in ONTAP 9.10.1 or 9.11.1, you must delete the consistency group, then create a new consistency group with the volumes you want to include.

.System Manager
--
Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, you can perform this operation with System Manager.

. Select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select the consistency group that you want to modify.
. If you are modifying a single consistency group, at the top of the *Volumes* menu, select *More* and then *Expand* to add a volume.
+
If you are modifying a child consistency group, identify the parent consistency group you want to modify. Select the *>* button to view the child consistency groups, then select image:../media/icon_kabob.gif[three vertically stacked dots] next to the name of the child consistency group you want to modify. From that menu, select *Expand*.
. Select up to 16 volumes to add to the consistency group.
. Select *Save*. When the operation completes, view the newly added volumes in the consistency group's *Volumes* menu. 
--

.CLI
--
Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can add volumes to a consistency group using the ONTAP CLI. 

.Add existing volumes
. Issue the following command. The `-volumes` parameter accepts a comma-separated list of volumes. 
+
[NOTE]
Only include the `-parent-consistency-group` parameter if the consistency group is in an hierarchical relationship. 
+
`consistency-group volume add -vserver _svm_name_ -consistency-group _consistency_group_name_ -parent-consistency-group _parent_consistency_group_ -volume _volumes_`

.Add new volumes
The procedure to add new volumes depends on the protocol you are using.

[NOTE]
Only include the `-parent-consistency-group` parameter if the consistency group is in an hierarchical relationship. 

* To add new volumes without exporting them:
+
`consistency-group volume create -vserver _SVM_name_ -consistency-group _child_consistency_group_ -parent-consistency-group existingParentCg -volume _volume_name_ -size _size_`


* To add new NFS volumes:
+
`consistency-group volume create -vserver _SVM_name_ -consistency-group _consistency-group-name_ -volume _volume-prefix_ -volume-count _number_ -size _size_ -export-policy _policy_name_`

* To add new SAN volumes:
+
`consistency-group volume create -vserver _SVM_name_ -consistency-group _consistency-group-name_ -lun _lun_name_ -size _size_ -lun-count _number_ -igroup _igroup_name_`

* To add new NVMe namespaces:
+
`consistency-group volume create -vserver _SVM_name_ -consistency-group _consistency_group_name_ -namespace _namespace_name_ -volume-count _number_ -namespace-count _number_ -size _size_ -subsystem _subsystem_name_`

== Remove volumes from a consistency group

Volumes removed from a consistency group are not deleted. They remain active in the cluster. 

.About this task
* You cannot remove volumes from a consistency group in a SnapMirror Business Continuity (SM-BC) relationship. You must first break the SM-BC relationship to modify the consistency group and then reestablish the relationship.
* If a consistency group has no volumes in it following the remove operation, the consistency group will be deleted.
* When a volume is removed from a consistency group, existing Snapshots of the consistency group remain but are considered invalid. The existing Snapshots cannot be used to restore the contents of the consistency group. Volume-granular Snapshots remain valid. 
* If you delete a volume from the cluster, it is automatically removed from the consistency group. 
* To change the configuration of a consistency group in ONTAP 9.10.1 or 9.11.1, you must delete the consistency group then create a new consistency group with the desired member volumes.
* Deleting a volume from the cluster will automatically remove it the consistency group.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can remove volumes from a consistency group using the CLI.

.Step
. Remove the volumes. The `-volumes` parameter accepts a comma-separated list of volumes. 
+
Only include the `-parent-consistency-group` parameter if the consistency group is in an hierarchical relationship. 
+
`consistency-group volume remove -vserver _SVM_name_ -consistency-group _consistency_group_name_ -parent-consistency-group _parent_consistency_group_name_ -volume _volumes_`

== Move volumes between consistency groups

Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, you can move volumes between child consistency groups that share a parent. 

.About this task
* You can only move volumes between consistency groups nested under the same parent consistency group. 
* Existing consistency group Snapshots become invalid and no longer accessible as consistency group snapshots. Individual volume Snapshots remain valid.
* Snapshot copies of the parent consistency group remain valid. 
* If you move all volumes out of a child consistency group, that consistency group will be deleted. 
* Modifications to a consistency group must abide by xref:limits.html[consistency group limits].
