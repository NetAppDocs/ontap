Consistency groups offer easily managed local and remote protection for SAN, NAS, and NVMe applications that span multiple volumes.

Creating a consistency group does not automatically enable protection. Local and/or remote protection policies can be set at the time of creation or after creating your consistency group. Protection policies can include local Snapshot copies or remote SnapMirror protection with SnapMirror Business Continuity (SM-BC). If you are utilizing nested consistency groups, different protection policies can be set for the individual volumes.

If you are utilizing remote SM-BC protection, to ensure snapshots copied on your consistency group are copied to the destination, the policy labels in the source and destination cluster must match. SM-BC will not replicate snapshots by default unless a rule with a SnapMirror label is added to the predefined AutomatedFailOver policy and the snapshots are created with that label. To learn more about this process, refer to xref:../task_san_configure_protection_for_business_continuity.adoc[Configure protection for business continuity].

Recovery can occur for an entire consistency group, a single consistency group in a hierarchical configuraiton, or for individual volumes within the consistency group. Recovery can be achieved by selecting the consistency group you want to recover from, selecting the Snapshot type, and then identifying the particular Snapshot to base the restoration on. For more on this process, see xref:../task_dp_restore_from_vault.html[Restore a volume from an earlier Snapshot copy].

Beginning in ONTAP 9.10.1, System Manager helps facilitate the management of LUN relationships under the *Protection > Relationships* menu. When you select a source relationship, System Manager displays a visualization of the source relationships. By selecting a volume, you can delve deeper into these relationships to see a list of the contained LUNs and the initiator group relationships. This information can be downloaded as an Excel workbook from the individual volume view. The task will run in the background.

== Set a local Snapshot protection policy

.Steps 
. Select the consistency group you have created from the Consistency group menu.
. At the top right of the overview page for the consistency group, select *Edit*.
. Check the box next to *Schedule snapshot copies (local)*.
. Select a Snapshot policy. To configure a new, custom policy, refer to xref:../task_dp_create_custom_data_protection_policies.html[Create a custom data protection policy].
. Select *Save*.
. Return to the consistency group overview menu. In the left column under *Snapshot Copies (Local)*, the status should say protected next to a green shield with a checkmark in it image:../media/icon_shield.png[alt=green shield icon].

== Set a remote SM-BC policy

.Steps
. Ensure you have met the prerequisites for using SM-BC. See xref:../smbc/smbc_plan_prerequisites.adoc[SM-BC prerequisites]
. Select the consistency group you have created from the Consistency group menu.
. At the top right of the overview page, select *More* then *Protect*.
. The source-side information should be autofilled on the left-hand side of the page.
. Select the appropriate cluster and storage VM for the destination. Select a protection policy. Ensure that *Initialize relationship* is checked.
. Click *Save*.
. The consistency group will have to initialize and synchronize. When this is complete, under *SnapMirror (Remote)* the status should say protected next to a green shield with a checkmark in it image:../media/icon_shield.png[alt=green shield icon].
