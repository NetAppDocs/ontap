[.lead]
Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, you can modify the geometry of a consistency group. Modifying the geometry of a consistency group enables you to alter the configuration of child or parent consistency groups without disruption to ongoing IO operations.

Modifying consistency group geometry will have an impact on existing snapshot copies. 

[NOTE]
You cannot modify the geometry of a consistency group that is configured with a remote protection policy. You must first break the protection relationship, modify the geometry, then restore remote protection. 

== Add a new child consistency group

Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, you can add a new child consistency group to an existing parent consistency group. 

.Before you begin
* A parent consistency group can contain a maximum of five child consistency groups. See xref:limits.html[consistency group limits] for other limits. 
* You cannot add a child consistency group to a single consistency group. You must first <<promote>> the consistency group, then you can add a child consistency group. 
* Existing Snapshot copies of the consistency group captured before the expand operation will be considered partial. Any restore operation based on that snapshot copy will reflect the consistency group at the point-in-time of the Snapshot copy.

.System Manager
--
Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, you can perform this operation with System Manager.


.Steps 
. Select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select the parent consistency group you want to which you want to add a child consistency group.
. Next to the parent consistency group's name, select **More** then **Add new child consistency group**. 
. Enter a name for your consistency group. 
. Choose whether you would like to add new or existing volumes.
.. If you are adding existing volumes, select **Existing volumes** then choose the volumes from the dropdown menu. 
.. If you are adding new volumes, select **New volumes** then designate the number of volumes and their size. 
. Select **Add**.

.CLI
--
Beginning in ONTAP 9.14.1, you can add a child consistency group using the ONTAP CLI.

.Add a child consistency group with new volumes
. Create the new consistency group. Provide values for the consistency group name, volume prefix, number of volumes, volume size, storage service, and export policy name:
+
`consistency-group create -vserver _SVM_name_ -consistency-group _consistency_group_ -parent-consistency-group _parent_consistency_group_ -volume-prefix _prefix_ -volume-count _number_ -size _size_ -storage-service _service_ -export-policy _policy_name_`


.Add a child consistency group with existing volumes
. Create the new consistency group. The `volumes` parameter accepts a comma-separate list of volume names. 
+
`consistency-group create -vserver _SVM_name_ -consistency-group _new_consistency_group_ -parent-consistency-group _parent_consistency_group_ -volumes _volume_`

[[detach, detach]]
== Detach a child consistency group 

Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, you can remove a child consistency group from its parent, converting it into an individual consistency group. 

.Before you begin
* Detaching a child consistency group causes the parent consistency group’s snapshots to become invalid and inaccessible. Volume granular snapshots remain valid.
* Existing Snapshot copies of the individual consistency group remain valid.
* This operation will fail if there is an existing single consistency group that has the same name as the child consistency group you intend to detach. If you encounter this scenario, you must rename the consistency group when you detach it.

.System Manager
--
Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, you can perform this operation with System Manager.

.Steps
. Select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select the parent consistency group that contains the child you want to detach. 
. Next to the child consistency group you want to detach, select **More** then **Detach from parent**.
. Optionally, rename the consistency group and select an application type. 
. Select **Detach**. 
--

.CLI
--
Beginning in ONTAP 9.14.1, you can detach a child consistency group using the ONTAP CLI.

.Steps
. Detach the consistency group. If you need to rename the detached consistency group, use the optional `-new-name` parameter and provide a unique name.
+
`consistency-group detach -vserver _SVM_name_ -consistency-group _child_consistency_group_ -parent-consistency-group _parent_consistency_group_ [-new-name _new_name_]`

== Move an existing single consistency group under a parent consistency group

Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, you can convert an existing single consistency group to a child consistency group. You can either move the consistency group under an existing parent consistency group or create a new parent consistency group during the move operation. 

.Before you begin
* The parent consistency group must have four or fewer children. A parent consistency group can contain a maximum of five child consistency groups. See xref:limits.html[consistency group limits] for other limits. 
* Existing snapshot copies of the _parent_ consistency group captured before this operation will be considered partial. Any restore operation based on one of those Snapshot copies will reflect the consistency group at the point-in-time of the Snapshot copy. 
* Existing consistency group snapshots of the single consistency group remain valid.

--
Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, you can perform this operation with System Manager.

.Steps
. Select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select the consistency group you want to convert. 
. Select **More** then **Move under different consistency group**. 
. Optionally, enter a new name for the consistency group and select a component type. By default, the component type will be Other.
. Choose if you want to migrate to an existing parent consistency group or create a new parent consistency group:
.. To migrate to an existing parent consistency group, select **Existing consistency group** then choose the consistency group from the dropdown menu.
.. To create a new parent consistency group, select **New consistency group** then provide a name for the new consistency group.
. Select **Move**.

.CLI
--
Beginning in ONTAP 9.14.1, you can move a single consistency group under a parent consistency group using the ONTAP CLI.

.Move a consistency group under a new parent consistency group
. Create the new parent consistency group. The `-consistency-groups` parameter will migrate any existing consistency groups to the new parent.
+
`consistency-group attach -vserver _svm_name_ -consistency-group _parent_consistency_group_ -consistency-groups _child_consistency_group_`

.Move a consistency group under an existing consistency group
. Move the consistency group:
+
`consistency-group add -vserver _SVM_name_ -consistency-group _consistency_group_ -parent-consistency-group _parent_consistency_group_`

[[promote, promote]]
== Promote a child consistency group

Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, you can promote a single consistency group to a parent consistency group. When you promote the single consistency group to a parent, you also create a new child consistency group that inherits all of the volumes in the original, single consistency group. 

.Before you begin
* If you want to convert a child consistency group to a parent consistency group, you must first <<detach>> the child consistency group then follow this procedure. 
* Existing Snapshot copies of the consistency group remain valid after you promote the consistency group.

== Demote a parent to a single consistency group

Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, you can demote a parent consistency group to a single consistency group. Demoting the parent flattens the hierarchy of the consistency group, removing all associated child consistency groups. All volumes in the consistency group will remain under the new, single consistency group. 

.Before you begin
* Existing Snapshot copies of the parent consistency group remain valid after you demote it to a single consistency. Existing Snapshot copies of any of the associated child consistency groups of that parent will become invalid, but the individual volume snapshots within them continue to be accessible as volume-granular Snapshots.
