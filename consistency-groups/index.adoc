[.lead]
A consistency group is a collection of volumes that provides a write-order consistency guarantee for an application workload spanning multiple volumes.

Consistency groups facilitate application workload management, providing easy management of local and remote protection policies and providing simultaneous crash-consistent or application-consistent Snapshot copies of a collection of volumes at a point in time. Snapshots in consistency groups enable an entire application workload to be restored.

Consistency groups support any FlexVol volume regardless of protocol (NAS, SAN, or NVMe) and can be managed through the ONTAP REST API or in System Manager under the *Storage > Consistency Groups* menu item.

Consistency groups can exist as individual entities or in a hierarchical relationship. An individual consistency group is a collection of volumes. Volumes can have their own volume-granular snapshot policy. In addition, the consistency group the volume is associated with can have its own snapshot policy. The consistency group can only have one SnapMirror Business Continuity (SM-BC) relationship and shared SM-BC policy, which can be used to recover the entire consistency group.

Larger application workloads might require multiple consistency groups. In these situations, multiple consistency groups can be placed together in a hierarchical relationship. In this configuration, single consistency groups become the child components of a parent consistency group. The parent consistency group can include up to five child consistency groups. Like in individual consistency groups, a remote SM-BC protection policy can be applied to the entire configuration of consistency groups (parent and children) to recover the application workload.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, consistency groups support xref:clone-task.html[cloning] and modifying the members of the consistency by xref:modify-task.html[adding or removing volumes] in both System Manager and the ONTAP REST API. Beginning in ONTAP 9.12.1, the ONTAP REST API also supports: 

* Creating a consistency group with new NFS or SMB volumes or NVMe namespaces. 
* Adding new or existing NFS or SMB volumes or NVMe namespaces to an existing consistency group. 

For more information about the ONTAP REST API, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-automation/reference/api_reference.html#access-a-copy-of-the-ontap-rest-api-reference-documentation[ONTAP REST API reference documentation]. 

== Protection

Consistency groups offer:
* local protection through Snapshot policies
* remote protection through SnapMirror Business Continuity (SM-BC).
Creating a consistency group does not automatically enable protection. Local and/or remote protection policies can be set when creating or after creating a consistency group. 

To configure local protection with consistency groups, see link:protect-task.html[Protect a consistency group]. Beginning in ONTAP 9.11.1, consistency groups offer link:protect-task.html#two-phase-CG-snapshot-creation[two-phase consistency group snapshot creation].

In order to utilize remote protection, you must meet the requirements for xref:../smbc/smbc_plan_prerequisites.html#licensing[SnapMirror Business Continuity deployments].

[NOTE]
SM-BC relationships cannot be established on volumes mounted for NAS access.

== Application and component tags 

Beginning in ONTAP 9.12.1, consistency groups support component and application tagging. Application and component tags are a management tool, enabling you to filter and identify different workloads in your consistency groups. 

There are two types of tags:
* **Application tags**: these apply to individual and parent consistency groups. Application tags provide labeling for workloads such as MongoDB, Oracle, or SQL Server. The default application tag for consistency groups is Other.
* **Component tags**: Children in hierarchal consistency groups have component tags instead of application tags. The options for component tags are "data", "logs", or "other". The default value is Other. 

You can apply tags when creating a consistency group or after the consistency group has been created. If the consistency group has an SM-BC relationship, you must use *Other* as the application or component tag. 

== Consistency groups in MetroCluster configurations

Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, you can provision consistency groups with new volumes on a cluster within a MetroCluster configuration. These volumes are provisioned on mirrored aggregates.

After they are provisioned, you can move volumes associated with consistency groups between mirrored and unmirrored aggregates. Therefore, they can be located on mirrored aggregates, unmirrored aggregates, or both. You can modify mirrored aggregates containing volumes associated with consistency groups to become unmirrored. Similarly, you can modify unmirrored aggregates containing volumes associated with consistency groups to enable mirroring.

Volumes associated with consistency groups placed on mirrored aggregates and their Snapshots, including any consistency group Snapshots, are replicated to the remote site (site B). The contents of the volumes on site B are consistency group semantics-compliant. You can access replicated consistency group Snapshots using consistency group Snapshot REST API and System Manager on clusters running ONTAP 9.11.1 or later.

If some or all the volumes associated with a consistency group are located on unmirrored aggregates that are not currently accessible, GET or DELETE operations on the consistency group behave as if the local volumes or hosting aggregates are offline.

=== Consistency group configuration replication

If site B is running ONTAP 9.10.1 or earlier, only the volumes associated with the consistency groups located on mirrored aggregates are replicated to site B. The consistency group configurations are only replicated to site B, if both sites are running ONTAP 9.11.1 or later. After site B is upgraded to ONTAP 9.11.1, data for consistency groups on site A that have all their associated volumes placed on mirrored aggregates are replicated to site B.

== Upgrade considerations

Consistency groups created with SM-BC in ONTAP 9.8 and 9.9.1 will automatically be upgraded and become manageable under *Storage > Consistency Groups* in System Manager or the ONTAP REST API when upgrading to ONTAP 9.10.1. For more information about upgrading, see link:../smbc/smbc_admin_upgrade_and_revert_considerations.html[SM-BC upgrade and revert considerations].

Consistency group snapshots created with the ONTAP REST API can be managed through System Manager’s Consistency Group interface and through consistency group API endpoints.

[NOTE]
Snapshots created with the ONTAPI commands `cg-start` and `cg-commit` will not be recognized as consistency group Snapshots and thus cannot be managed through System Manager's Consistency Group interface or the consistency group endpoints in the ONTAP API.
