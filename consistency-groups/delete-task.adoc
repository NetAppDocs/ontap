[.lead]
If you decide that you no longer need a consistency group, you can delete it. 

.About this task
* Deleting a consistency group deletes the instance of the consistency group and does *not* impact the constituent volumes or LUNs. Deleting a consistency group does not result in deletion of the Snapshots present on each volume, but they will no longer be accessible as consistency group Snapshots. The Snapshots can, however, continue to be managed as ordinary volume granular snapshots.

* ONTAP automatically deletes a consistency group if all of the volumes in the consistency group are deleted.

* Deleting a parent consistency group results in the deletion of all associated child consistency groups.

* If you are using a version of ONTAP between 9.10.1 to 9.12.0, volumes can only be removed from a consistency group if the volume itself is deleted, in which case the volume is automatically removed from the consistency group. Beginning in ONTAP 9.12.1, you can remove volumes from a consistency group without deleting the consistency group. For more information on this process, refer to xref:modify-task.html[Modify a consistency group].
