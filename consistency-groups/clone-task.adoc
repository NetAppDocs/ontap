[.lead]
Beginning in ONTAP 9.12.1, you can clone a consistency group to create a copy of a consistency group and its contents. Cloning a consistency group creates a copy of the consistency group configuration, its metadata such as application type, and all the volumes and its contents such as files, directories, LUNs or NVMe namespaces. 

.About this task
When cloning a consistency group, you can clone it with its current configuration, but with volume contents as they are or based on an existing consistency group Snapshot.

Cloning a consistency group is supported only for the entire consistency group. You cannot clone an individual child consistency group in a hierarchical relationship: only the complete consistency group configuration can be cloned. 

When you clone a consistency group, the following components are not cloned:

- iGroups
- LUN maps
- NVMe subsystems
- NVMe namespace subsystem maps

.Before you begin
* When you clone a consistency group, ONTAP will not create SMB shares for the cloned volumes if a share name is not specified. * Cloned consistency groups are not mounted if a junction path is not specified.
* If you attempt to clone a consistency group based on a Snapshot that does not reflect the consistency group's current constituent volumes, the operation will fail. 
* After you clone a consistency group, you need to perform the appropriate mapping operation.
+
Refer to xref:../task_san_map_igroups_to_multiple_luns.html[Map igroups to multiple LUNs] or xref:../san-admin/map-nvme-namespace-subsystem-task.html[Map an NVMe namespace to a subsystem] for more information. 
* Cloning a consistency group is not supported for a consistency group in a SnapMirror Business Continuity relationship or with any associated DP volumes. 
// * 9.14.1: Cloning a parent consistency group will clone the parent and all associated children consistency groups.

.Steps 
. Select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select the consistency group you want to clone from the *Consistency Group* menu.
. At the top right of the overview page for the consistency group, select *Clone*.
. Enter a name for the new, cloned consistency group or accept the default name.
.. Choose if you want to enable link:../concepts/thin-provisioning-concept.html[*Thin Provisioning*^].
.. Choose *Split Clone* if you want to dissociate the consistency group from its source and allocate additional disk space for the cloned consistency group.
. To clone the consistency group in its current state, choose *Add a new Snapshot copy*. 
+
To clone the consistency group based on a snapshot, choose *Use an existing Snapshot copy*. Selecting this option will open a new sub-menu. Choose the Snapshot that you want to use as the basis for the clone operation.
. Select *Clone*.
. Return to the *Consistency Group* menu to confirm your consistency group has been cloned.

.CLI
--
Beginning in ONTAP 9.14.1, you can clone a consistency group using the CLI.

.Clone a single consistency group
. To clone the consistency group based at its present point in time, issue the following command:
+
`consistency-group clone create -vserver _svm_name_ -consistency-group _clone_name_ -source-consistency-group _consistency_group_name_`
+
To base the clone on a Snapshot of a consistency group, add the `-source-snapshot _snapshot_name_` parameter.
