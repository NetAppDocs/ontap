[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, consistency groups support component and application tagging. Application and component tags are a management tool, enabling you to filter and identify different workloads in your consistency groups. 

.About this task

Consistency groups offer two types of tags:

* **Application tags**: these apply to individual and parent consistency groups. Application tags provide labeling for workloads such as MongoDB, Oracle, or SQL Server. The default application tag for consistency groups is Other.
* **Component tags**: Children in hierarchal consistency groups have component tags instead of application tags. The options for component tags are "data", "logs", or "other". The default value is Other. 

You can apply tags when creating consistency groups or after the consistency groups have been created.

[IMPORTANT]
If the consistency group has an SM-BC relationship, you must use *Other* as the application or component tag.

.Steps
Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, you can modify application and component tags using System Manager. Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can modify the application and component tags using the ONTAP CLI.

.CLI
--
Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can modify the application or component tag of an existing consistency group using the ONTAP CLI. 

.Modify the application tag
. Application tags accept a limited number of preset strings. To see, the accepted list of strings, run the following command: 
`consistency-group modify -vserver _svm_name_ -consistency-group _consistency_group_ -application-type ?`
. Choose the appropriate string from the output, the modify the consistency group:
`consistency-group modify -vserver _svm_name_ -consistency-group _consistency_group_ -application-type application_type`


.Modify the component tag
. Modify the component type. The component type can be data, logs, or other. If you are using SM-BC, it must be "other."
`consistency-group modify -vserver _svm_ -consistency-group _child_consistency_group_ -parent-consistency-group _parent_consistency_group_ -application-component-type [data|logs|other]`
