[.lead]
Consistency groups can be created with existing volumes or new LUNs or volumes (depending on the version of ONTAP). A volume or LUN can only be associated with one consistency group at a time. 

.About this task
* In ONTAP 9.10.1 through 9.11.1, modifying the member volumes of a consistency group after it is created is not supported.
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, you can modify the member volumes of a consistency group. For more information on this process, refer to xref:modify-task.html[Modify a consistency group].

* Beginning with ONTAP 9.17.1, you can select the NVMe protocol to map a host to an NVMe subsystem for VMware workloads in a SnapMirror active sync configuration. 

== Create a consistency group with new LUNs or volumes

In ONTAP 9.10.1 through 9.12.1, you can create a consistency group using new LUNs. Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, System Manager also supports creating a consistency group with new NVMe namespaces or new NAS volumes. (This is also supported in the ONTAP REST API beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1.)

.Steps
. Select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select *+Add* then select the protocol for your storage object. 
+
In ONTAP 9.10.1 through 9.12.1, the only option for a new storage object is **Using new LUNs**. Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, System Manager supports creating consistency groups with new NVMe namespaces and new NAS volumes. 
. Name the consistency group. Designate the number of volumes or LUNs and the capacity per volume or LUN.
.. **Application Type**: If you are using ONTAP 9.12.1 or later, select an application type. If no value is selected, the consistency group will be assigned the type of **Other** by default. Learn more about tagging consistency in xref:modify-tags-task.html[Application and component tags]. If you plan to create a consistency group with a remote protection policy, you must use *Other*.
.. For **New LUNs**: Select the host operating system and LUN format. Enter the host initiator information.
.. For **New NAS volumes**: choose the appropriate export option (NFS or SMB/CIFS) based on the NAS configuration of your SVM. 
.. For **New NVMe namespaces**: Select the host operating system and NVMe subsystem.
. To configure protection policies, add a child consistency group, or access permissions, select *More options*.
. Select *Save*.
. Confirm your consistency group has been created by returning to the main consistency group menu where it will appear once the job completes. If you set a protection policy, you will know it has been applied when you see a green shield under look under the appropriate policy, remote or local.

.CLI
--
Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can create a new consistency group with new volumes using the ONTAP CLI. The specific parameters depends on whether the volumes are SAN, NVMe, or NFS.

include::../_include/consistency-group-cli.adoc[]

.Create a consistency group with NFS volumes
. Create the consistency group:
+
`consistency-group create -vserver <SVM_name> -consistency-group <consistency-group-name> -volume-prefix <prefix_for_new_volume_names> -volume-count <number> -size <size> -export-policy <policy_name>`

.Create a consistency group with SAN volumes
. Create the consistency group:
+
`consistency-group create -vserver <SVM_name> -consistency-group <consistency-group-name> -lun <lun_name> -size <size> -lun-count <number> -lun-os-type <LUN_operating_system_format> -igroup <igroup_name>`

.Create a consistency group with NVMe namespaces
. Create the consistency group:
+
`consistency-group create -vserver <SVM_name> -consistency-group <consistency_group_name> -namespace <namespace_name> -volume-count <number> -namespace-count <number> -size <size> -subsystem <subsystem_name>`
+

.After you're done
. Confirm your consistency group has been created using the `consistency-group show` command.

== Create a consistency group with existing volumes

You can use existing volumes to create a consistency group.

[role="tabbed-block"]
====
.System Manager (ONTAP 9.16.1 and earlier)
--
.Steps
. Select *Storage > Consistency groups*.
. Select *+Add* then *Using existing volumes*.
. Name the consistency group and select the storage VM.
.. **Application Type**: If you are using ONTAP 9.12.1 or later, select an application type. If no value is selected, the consistency group will be assigned the type of **Other** by default. Learn more about tagging consistency in xref:modify-tags-task.html[Application and component tags]. If the consistency group has a SnapMirror active sync relationship, you must use *Other*.
[NOTE]
In versions of ONTAP earlier than ONTAP 9.15.1, SnapMirror active sync is referred to as SnapMirror Business Continuity.
. Select the existing volumes to include. Only volumes that are not already part of a consistency group will be available for selection.
+
[NOTE]
If creating a consistency group with existing volumes, the consistency group supports FlexVol volumes. Volumes with or SnapMirror synchronous or SnapMirror asynchronous relationships can be added to consistency groups, but they are not consistency group-aware. Consistency groups do not support S3 buckets or storage VMs with SVMDR relationships.
+
. Select *Save*.
. Confirm your consistency group has been created by returning to the main consistency group menu where it appears once the ONTAP job completes. If you have chosen a protection policy, confirm it was properly set by selecting your consistency group from the menu. If you set a protection policy, you know it has been applied when you see a green shield under look under the appropriate policy, remote or local.

.CLI
--
Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can create a consistency group with existing volumes using the ONTAP CLI. 

include::../_include/consistency-group-cli.adoc[]

.Steps
. Issue the `consistency-group create` command. The `-volumes` parameter accepts a comma-separated list of volume names.
+
`consistency-group create -vserver <SVM_name> -consistency-group <consistency-group-name> -volume <volumes>`
+
