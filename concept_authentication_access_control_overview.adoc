You can manage ONTAP cluster authentication and access control to ONTAP web services.

Using System Manager or the CLI, you can control and secure client and administrator access to the cluster and storage. 

If you are using the classic System Manager (available only in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier), refer to  https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-system-manager-classic/index.html[System Manager Classic (ONTAP 9.0 to 9.7)^]

== Client authentication and authorization

ONTAP authenticates a client machine and user by verifying their identities with a trusted source. ONTAP authorizes a user to access a file or directory by comparing the user's credentials with the permissions configured on the file or directory.

== Administrator authentication and RBAC

Administrators use local or remote login accounts to authenticate themselves to the cluster and storage VM. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) determines the commands to which an administrator has access.
