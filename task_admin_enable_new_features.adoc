In releases earlier than ONTAP 9.10.1, ONTAP features are enabled with license keys, and features in ONTAP 9.10.1 and later are enabled with a NetApp license file. You can add license keys and NetApp license files using System Manager.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you use System Manager to install a NetApp License File to enable multiple licensed features all at once. Using a NetApp License File simplifies license installation because you no longer have to add separate feature license keys. You download the NetApp License File from the NetApp Support Site.

If you already have license keys for some features and you are upgrading to ONTAP 9.10.1, you can continue to use those license keys.

.Steps

. Select *Cluster > Settings*.
. Under *Licenses*, select image:icon_arrow.gif[Arrow icon].
. Select *Browse*. Choose the NetApp License File you downloaded.
. If you have license keys you want to add, select *Use 28-character license keys* and enter the keys.
