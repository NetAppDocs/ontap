ONTAP provides several approaches a customer might use to achieve file-level ABAC, including Labeled NFSv4.2 and XATTRS using NFS and SMB/CIFS.

== Labeled NFSv4.2

Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, the NFSv4.2 feature called Labeled NFS is supported. 

Labeled NFS is a way to manage granular file and folder access by using SELinux labels and Mandatory Access Control (MAC). These MAC labels are stored with files and folders, and they work in conjunction with UNIX permissions and NFSv4.x ACLs. 

Support for Labeled NFS means that ONTAP now recognizes and understands the NFS client`s SELinux label settings. Labeled NFS is covered in RFC-7204.

Use Cases for Labeled NFSv4.2 include the following:

* MAC labeling of virtual machine (VM) images
* Data security classification for the public sector (secret, top secret, and other classifications)
* Security compliance
* Diskless Linux

.Enable Labeled NFSv4.2

You can enable or disable Labeled NFS with the following advanced privilege option:

[source,cli]
----
[-v4.2-seclabel {enabled|disabled}] - NFSV4.2 Security Label Support (privilege: advanced)
----

This parameter is optional, and the default setting is `disabled`.

.Enforcement modes for Labeled NFSv4.2

Beginning in ONTAP 9.9.1, ONTAP supports the following enforcement modes:

* *Limited Server Mode*: ONTAP cannot enforce the labels but can store and transmit them.
+
NOTE: The ability to change MAC labels is also up to the client to enforce.

* *Guest Mode*: If the client is not labeled NFS-aware (v4.1 or lower), MAC labels are not transmitted.

NOTE: ONTAP does not currently support Full Mode (storing and enforcing MAC labels).

.Example configuration of Labeled NFSv4.2

The following example configuration demonstrates concepts using Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 9.3 (Plow). 

The user `jrsmith`, created based on John R. Smith's credentials, has the following account privileges:

* Username = `jrsmith`
* Privileges = `uid=1112(jrsmith) gid=1112(jrsmith) groups=1112(jrsmith) context=user_u:user_r:user_t:s0`

There are two roles: the admin account that is a privileged user and user `jrsmith` as described in the following MLS privileges table:

[width="100%",cols="26%a,24%a,25%a,25%a",options="header",]
|===
|Users |Role |Type |Levels
|`admins` |`sysadm_r` |`sysadm_t` |`t:s0`
|`jrsmith` |`user_r` |`user_t` |`t:s1 - t:s4`
|===

For this example environment, user `jrsmith` has access to files at the levels s0 to s3. We could translate that security classification shown below adding additional security that admins do not have access to user data.

* s0 = privilege admin user data
* s0 = unclassified data
* s1 = confidential
* s2 = secret data
* s3 = top secret data

[NOTE]
Follow your security policies of your organization

.Example of NFSv4.2 security label with MCS

In addition to MLS, another capability called Multi-Category Security (MCS) allows you to define categories such as projects.

== Extended Attributes (XATTRS) 
Beginning in ONTAP 9.12.1, ONTAP supports xattrs. xattrs allow metadata to be associated with files and directories beyond what is provided by the system, such as access control lists (ACLs) or user-defined attributes. 

To implement xattrs, you can use `setfattr` and `getfattr` command-line utilities in Linux for managing xattrs of file system objects. These tools provide a powerful way to manage additional metadata for files and directories. They should be used with care though as improper use can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues. Always refer to the `setfattr` and `getfattr` man pages or other reliable documentation for detailed usage instructions. 

When xattrs is enabled on an ONTAP filesystem, users can set, modify, and retrieve arbitrary attributes on files. These attributes can be used to store additional information about the file that is not captured by the standard set of file attributes, such as access control information.

.Requirements for using xattrs in ONTAP

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 or later
* Ubuntu 22.04 or later
* Each file can have up to 128 xattrs
* xattr keys are limited to 255 bytes
* The combined key or value size is 1,729 bytes per xattr
* Directories and files can have xattrs
* To set and retrieve xattrs, `w` or write mode bits must be enabled for the user and group

.Use cases for xattrs

xattrs are implemented in the `user` namespace; they have no inherent meaning to ONTAP. Use cases are defined and controlled strictly by the client-side application. 

Use case examples:

* Storing the name of an application that created a file.
* Keeping a link to the email message a file was downloaded from.
* Implementing a categorization system for file objects.
* Tagging downloaded files with the URL the file was downloaded from.

.Commands for managing xattrs

* `setfattr`: Sets an extended attribute of a file or directory: 
+
`setfattr -n <attribute_name> -v <attribute_value> <file or directory name>`
+
Sample command: 
+
`setfattr -n user.comment -v test example.txt`

* `getfattr`: Retrieves the value of a specific extended attribute or lists all extended attributes of a file or directory:
+
Specific attribute:
`getfattr -n <attribute_name> <file or directory name>`
+
All attributes:
`getfattr <file or directory name>`
+
Sample command:
+
`getfattr -n user.comment example.txt`

== SMB/CIFS protocol support for xattrs

ONTAP's support for the CIFS/SMB protocol extends to comprehensive handling of xattrs, which are an integral part of file metadata in Windows environments. Extended attributes allow users and applications to store additional information beyond the standard set of file attributes, such as author details, custom security descriptors, or application-specific data. ONTAP's CIFS/SMB implementation ensures that these xattrs are fully supported, allowing for seamless integration with Windows services and applications that depend on this metadata for functionality and policy enforcement.

When files are accessed or transferred over CIFS/SMB shares managed by ONTAP, the system preserves the integrity of xattrs, ensuring that all metadata is retained and remains consistent. This is particularly important for maintaining security settings and for applications that rely on xattrs for configuration or operation. ONTAP's robust handling of xattrs within the CIFS/SMB context ensures that file sharing across different platforms and environments is reliable and secure, providing users with a seamless experience and administrators with the assurance that data governance policies are upheld. Whether it's for collaboration, data archiving, or compliance, ONTAP's attention to xattrs within CIFS/SMB shares represents its commitment to data management excellence and interoperability in mixed-OS environments.

== Policy enforcement point (PEP) and Policy Decision Point (PDP) in ABAC

In an attribute-based access control (ABAC) system, the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) and Policy Decision Point (PDP) play crucial roles. The PEP is responsible for enforcing access control policies, while the PDP makes the decision on whether to grant or deny access based on the policies.

In the context of the Python code snippet provided, the script itself acts as a PEP. It enforces the access control decision by either granting access to the file by opening it and reading its contents or denying access by raising a `PermissionError`.

The PDP, on the other hand, would be part of the underlying SELinux system. When the script tries to open the file with a specific SELinux context, the SELinux system checks its policies to decide whether to grant or deny access. This decision is then enforced by the script.

Below is a step-by-step example breakdown of how this code works in an ABAC environment:

. The script sets the SELinux context to `jrsmith` context using the `selinux.setcon()` function. This is equivalent to `jrsmith` trying to access the file.
. The script tries to open the file. This is where the PEP comes into play.
. The SELinux system checks its policies to see if `jrsmith` (or more specifically, a user with `jrsmith` SELinux context) is allowed to access the file. This is the PDP's role.
. If `jrsmith` is allowed to access the file, the SELinux system lets the script open the file, and the script reads and prints the file's contents.
. If `jrsmith` is not allowed to access the file, the SELinux system prevents the script from opening the file, and the script raises a `PermissionError`.
. The script restores the original SELinux context to ensure that the temporary context change does not affect other operations.

Using python, the code to get the context is shown below where the variable file path is the document that is to be checked:

----
#Get the current context

context = selinux.getfilecon(file_path)[1]
----

== ONTAP cloning and SnapMirror

ONTAP's cloning and SnapMirror technologies are designed to provide efficient and reliable data replication and cloning capabilities, ensuring that all aspects of file data, including extended attributes (xattrs), are preserved, and transferred along with the file. xattrs are critical as they store additional metadata associated with a file, such as security labels, access control information, and user-defined data, which are essential for maintaining the file's context and integrity.

When a volume is cloned using ONTAP's FlexClone technology, an exact writable replica of the volume is created. This cloning process is instantaneous and space-efficient, and it includes all file data and metadata, ensuring that xattrs are fully replicated. Similarly, SnapMirror ensures that data is mirrored to a secondary system with full fidelity. This includes xattrs, which are crucial for applications that rely on this metadata to function correctly.

By including xattrs in both cloning and replication operations, NetApp ONTAP ensures that the complete dataset, with all its characteristics, is available and consistent across primary and secondary storage systems. This comprehensive approach to data management is vital for organizations that require consistent data protection, quick recovery, and adherence to compliance and regulatory standards. It also simplifies the management of data across different environments, whether on-premises or in the cloud, providing users with the confidence that their data is complete and unaltered during these processes.

[NOTE]
NFSv4.2 Security Labels have the caveats defined in <<Labeled NFSv4.2>>.

== Example of controlling access to data

The following example entry for data stored in John R Smith`s PKI cert shows how NetApp`s approach can be applied to a file and provide fine-grained access control.

NOTE: This example is for illustrative purposes, and it is the government's responsibility to define what metadata is NFSv4.2 security label and xattrs. Details on updating and label retention are omitted for simplicity.

These PKI entitlements show John R. Smith's access details, including access by data type and attribution.

If John R. Smith created and saved a document called, _"sample_analysis.doc"_, according to the relevant policy guidance issuances the user would add the appropriate banner and portion markings, agency and office of origin, and appropriate classification authority block based on the classification of the document as shown in the following image. This rich metadata is only understandable after it has been scanned by Natural Language Processing (NLP) and had rules applied to make meaning from the markings. Tools such as NetApp BlueXP Classification can do that but are less efficient for access control decisions because they require permission to look inside the document.

Unclassified CAPCO document portion marking:

image:abac-unclassified.png[An example of a Unclassified CAPCO document portion marking]

In the event that the IC-TDF metadata is separate from the file, we propose storing fine-grained access control information at the file directory level and with associations to each file. To simplify the example, several tags are associated with the file. NFS 4.2 Security Labels are used for security decisions and xattrs for supplemental information related to the file and organizational program requirements.

== Auditing changes to labels

Auditing changes to xattrs or NFS security labels is a critical aspect of file system management and security. Standard file system auditing tools enable the monitoring and logging of all changes to a file system, including modifications to extended attributes and security labels.

In Linux environments, the `auditd` daemon is commonly used to establish auditing for file system events. It allows administrators to configure rules to watch for specific system calls related to xattr changes, such as `setxattr`, `lsetxattr`, and `fsetxattr` for setting attributes and `removexattr`, `lremovexattr`, and `fremovexattr` for removing attributes.

ONTAP FPolicy extends these capabilities by providing a robust framework for real-time monitoring and control of file operations. FPolicy can be configured to support various xattr events, offering granular control over file operations and the ability to enforce comprehensive data management policies.

For users utilizing xattrs, especially in NFSv3 and NFSv4 environments, only certain combinations of file operations and filters are supported for monitoring. The list of supported file operation and filter combinations for FPolicy monitoring of NFSv3 and NFSv4 file access events is detailed below:

[width="100%",cols="25%a,75%a",options="header",]
|===
|Supported file operations |Supported filters
|`setattr` |`offline-bit, setattr_with_owner_change, setattr_with_group_change, setattr_with_mode_change, setattr_with_modify_time_change, setattr_with_access_time_change, setattr_with_size_change, exclude_directory`
|===

----

Enabling ONTAP FPolicy for users working with xattrs provides a layer of visibility and control that is essential for maintaining the integrity and security of the file system. By leveraging FPolicy's advanced monitoring capabilities, organizations can ensure that all changes to xattrs are tracked, audited, and aligned with their security and compliance standards. This proactive approach to file system management is why enabling ONTAP FPolicy is highly recommended for any organization looking to enhance its data governance and protection strategies.

== Integration with ABAC identity and access control software

To fully harness the capabilities of Attribute-based access control (ABAC), ONTAP can integrate ONTAP with an ABAC-oriented identity and access management software. 

NOTE: In parallel to this content, NetApp has a reference implementation using GreyBox. One assumption for this content is that the government`s identity, authentication, and access services include at minimum a Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) and a Policy Decision Point (PDP) that act as intermediaries for access to the file system.

In a practical setting, an organization would employ a blend of NFS security labels and xattrs. These are used to represent a variety of metadata, including classification, security, application, and content, which are all instrumental in making ABAC decisions. XATTR, for instance, can be used to store the resource attributes that the PDP uses for its decision-making process. An attribute could be defined to represent the classification level of a file (for example, "Unclassified", "Confidential", "Secret", or "Top Secret"). The PDP could then utilize this attribute to enforce a policy that restricts users to only access files that have a classification level equal to or lower than their clearance level.

.Example process flow for ABAC

. User presents credentials (for example, PKI, Oauth, SAML) to system access to PEP and gets results from PDP. 
+
The PEP's role is to intercept the user's access request and forward it to the PDP.

. The PDP then evaluates this request against the established ABAC policies. 
+
These policies consider various attributes related to the user, the resource in question, and the surrounding environment. Based on these policies, the PDP makes an access decision to either allow or deny and then communicates this decision back to the PEP. 
+
PDP provides policy to PEP to enforce. The PEP then enforces this decision, either granting or denying the user's access request as per the PDP's decision.

. After a successful request, the user requests a file stored in ONTAP (AFF, AFF-C, for example).
. If the request is successful, PEP gets fine-grain access control tags from document.
. PEP requests policy for user based on that user's certs.
. PEP makes decision based on policy and tags if the user has access to the file and lets the user retrieve the file.

[NOTE]
The actual access might be done using tokens not proxied through.
