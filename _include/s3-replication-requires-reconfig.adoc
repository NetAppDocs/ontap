Although SnapMirror S3 replicates objects from the source bucket to a destination bucket, it does not replicate group and bucket policies from the source object store to the destination object store.

Users, group policies, permissions, and similar components, must be configured on the destination object store so that clients can access the destination bucket during a failover event.
