Although SnapMirror S3 replicates objects from the source bucket to a destination bucket, it does not replicate users, groups, and policies from the source object store to the destination object store.

Users, group policies, permissions, and similar components must be configured on the destination object store so that clients can access the destination bucket during a failover event.

Source and destination users can use the same access and secret keys provided the source keys are manually provided when the user is created on the destination cluster. For example:

----
vserver object-store-server user create -vserver svm1 -user user1 -access-key "20-characters" -secret-key "40-characters"
---- 

// 2025-April 25, Source and destination users can use the same keys
