Some local tier (aggregate) administration tasks require that you know what types of drives compose the local tier, their size, checksum, and status, whether they are shared with other local tiers, and the size and composition of the RAID groups.

.Step

. Show the drives for the aggregate, by RAID group:
+
`storage aggregate show-status _aggr_name_`
+
The drives are displayed for each RAID group in the aggregate.
+
You can see the RAID type of the drive (data, parity, dparity) in the `Position` column. If the `Position` column displays `shared`, then the drive is shared: if it is an HDD, it is a partitioned disk; if it is an SSD, it is part of a storage pool.

.Example: A Flash Pool aggregate using an SSD storage pool and data partitions

   RAID Group /nodeA_fp_1/plex0/rg0 (normal, block checksums, raid_dp)
