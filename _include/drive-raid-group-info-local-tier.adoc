.Step

. Show the drives for the aggregate, by RAID group:
+
`storage aggregate show-status _aggr_name_`
+
The drives are displayed for each RAID group in the aggregate.
+
You can see the RAID type of the drive (data, parity, dparity) in the `Position` column. If the `Position` column displays `shared`, then the drive is shared: if it is an HDD, it is a partitioned disk; if it is an SSD, it is part of a storage pool.

.Example: A Flash Pool aggregate using an SSD storage pool and data partitions
