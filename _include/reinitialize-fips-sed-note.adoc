[NOTE]
If an HA pair is using link:../encryption-at-rest/support-storage-encryption-concept.html[encrypting SAS or NVMe drives (SED, NSE, FIPS)], you must follow the instructions in the topic link:../encryption-at-rest/return-seds-unprotected-mode-task.html[Returning a FIPS drive or SED to unprotected mode] for all drives within the HA pair prior to initializing the system (boot options 4 or 9). Failure to do this may result in future data loss if the drives are repurposed.
