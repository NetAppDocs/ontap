.About this task

ONTAP configures KMIP server connectivity for all nodes in the cluster.

.Before you begin

* The KMIP SSL client and server certificates must have been installed.
* You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.
* You must configure the MetroCluster environment before you configure an external key manager.
* In a MetroCluster environment, you must install the same KMIP SSL certificate on both clusters.

.Steps

. Configure key manager connectivity for cluster nodes:
+
`security key-manager setup`
+
The key manager setup starts.
+
NOTE: In a MetroCluster environment, you must run this command on both clusters. 

. Enter the appropriate response at each prompt.
. Add a KMIP server:
+
`security key-manager add -address key_management_server_ipaddress`
+
----
clusterl::> security key-manager add -address 20.1.1.1
----
+
NOTE: In a MetroCluster environment, you must run this command on both clusters. 

. Add an additional KMIP server for redundancy:
+
`security key-manager add -address key_management_server_ipaddress`
+
----
clusterl::> security key-manager add -address 20.1.1.2
----
+
NOTE: In a MetroCluster environment, you must run this command on both clusters. 

. Verify that all configured KMIP servers are connected:
+
`security key-manager show -status`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
----
cluster1::> security key-manager show -status

Node            Port      Registered Key Manager  Status
--------------  ----      ----------------------  ---------------
cluster1-01     5696      20.1.1.1                available
cluster1-01     5696      20.1.1.2                available
cluster1-02     5696      20.1.1.1                available
cluster1-02     5696      20.1.1.2                available
----

. Optionally, convert plain text volumes to encrypted volumes.
+
`volume encryption conversion start`
+
An external key manager must be fully configured before you convert the volumes. In a MetroCluster environment, an external key manager must be configured on both sites.
