* MetroCluster configurations do not support front-end FC fabric "`routed`" vSAN configurations.

* Beginning with ONTAP 9.15.1, four-node MetroCluster IP configurations are supported on NVMe/TCP. 

* Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, four-node MetroCluster IP configurations are supported on NVMe/FC. MetroCluster configurations are not supported for front-end NVMe networks before ONTAP 9.12.1.

* Other SAN protocols such as iSCSI, FC, and FCoE are supported on MetroCluster configurations.

* When using SAN client configurations, you must check whether any special considerations for MetroCluster configurations are included in the notes that are provided in the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] (IMT).

* Operating systems and applications must provide an I/O resiliency of 120 seconds to support MetroCluster automatic unplanned switchover and Tiebreaker or Mediator-initiated switchover.

* MetroCluster configurations use the same WWNNs and WWPNs on both sides of the front-end FC fabric.
