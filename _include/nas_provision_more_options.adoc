You can customize the volume configuration when you add volumes instead of accepting the system defaults.

.Procedure

After clicking *More options*, select the functionality you need and enter the required values.

* Cache for remote volume.

*	Performance service level (quality of service, QoS).
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can specify a custom QoS policy or disable QoS, in addition to the default Value selection.

**	To disable QoS, select *Custom*, *Existing*, then *none*.

**	If you select *Custom* and specify an existing service level, a local tier is automatically chosen.

**	Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, if you choose to create a custom performance service level, you can use System Manager to manually select the local tier (*Manual placement*) on which you want to place the volume you are creating.
+
This option is not available if you select the remote cache or FlexGroup volume options.

*	FlexGroup volumes (select *Distribute volume data across the cluster*).
+
This option is not available if you previously selected *Manual placement* under *Performance Service Level*.   Otherwise, the volume you are adding becomes a FlexVol volume by default.

*	Access permissions for the protocols for which the volume is configured.

*	Data protection with SnapMirror (local or remote), then specify the protection policy and settings for the destination cluster from the pull-down lists.

* Select *Save* to create the volume and add it to the cluster and storage VM.
