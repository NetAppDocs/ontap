Beginning with ONTAP 9.18.1, the `storage aggregate show-space` command changes how Logical Referenced Capacity and Logical Unreferenced Capacity is reported. Logical Referenced Capacity reports referenced blocks in all objects and unreferenced blocks in fragmented objects. Logical Unreferenced Capacity reports only unreferenced blocks in objects that have crossed the fullness threshold and are eligible for object deletion and defragmentation.

For example, when you use the default aggregate fullness threshold of 40% for ONTAP S3 and StorageGRID, 60% of the blocks in an object must be unreferenced before the blocks are reported as unreferenced capacity.

In releases earlier than ONTAP 9.18.1, Logical Referenced Capacity reports referenced blocks in all objects (both full and fragmented objects). Logical Unreferenced Capacity reports unreferenced blocks in all objects.
