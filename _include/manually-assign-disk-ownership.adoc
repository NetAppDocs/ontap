If your cluster is not configured to use automatic disk ownership assignment, you must assign ownership manually.

You cannot reassign ownership of a disk that is in use in a local tier.

.Steps

. Using the CLI, display all unowned disks:
+
`storage disk show -container-type unassigned`
. Assign each disk:
+
`storage disk assign -disk _disk_name_ -owner _owner_name_`
+
You can use the wildcard character to assign more than one disk at once. If you are reassigning a spare disk that is already owned by a different node, you must use the "`-force`" option.
