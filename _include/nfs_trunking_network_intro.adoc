.About this task

A one-to-one mapping of LIFs and NICs yields the greatest performance gain but is not required to enable trunking. Having at least two NICs installed can offer a performance benefit, but it is not required. 

All LIFs in the trunking group should belong to the same failover group. Note that when the LIFs are configured in a failover group on the same node, a controller failover on that node can cause the LIFs to go offline. If the LIFs are not configured in a failover group on the same node and failover to another node, then trunking will no longer function.

You should adjust the trunking failover group any time you add or remove connections (and underlying NICs) from a failover group.

.Before you begin

* You must know the port names associated with the NICs to create a failover group.
* The ports must all be on the same node.
