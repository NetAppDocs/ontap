It provides all the commands you need to configure and manage the cluster. The clustershell CLI help (triggered by `?` at the clustershell prompt) displays available clustershell commands. The `man` command in the clustershell displays the man page for the specified clustershell command (`man <command_name>`). Learn more about `man` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/man.html[ONTAP command reference^].

* The nodeshell is a special shell for commands that take effect only at the node level.
+
The nodeshell is accessible through the `system node run` command. Learn more about `system node run` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/system-node-run.html[ONTAP command reference^].
+
The nodeshell CLI help (triggered by `?` or `help` at the nodeshell prompt) displays available nodeshell commands. The `man` command in the nodeshell displays the man page for the specified nodeshell command.

Many commonly used nodeshell commands and options are tunneled or aliased into the clustershell and can be executed also from the clustershell.

* The systemshell is a low-level shell that is used only for diagnostic and troubleshooting purposes.
+
The systemshell and the associated "`diag`" account are intended for low-level diagnostic purposes. Their access requires the diagnostic privilege level and is reserved only for technical support to perform troubleshooting tasks.
