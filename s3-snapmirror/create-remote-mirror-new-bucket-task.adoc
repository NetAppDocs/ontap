When you create new S3 buckets, you can protect them immediately to a SnapMirror S3 destination on a remote cluster.

.About this task

You will need to perform tasks on both source and destination systems.

.Before you begin

* Requirements for ONTAP versions, licensing, and S3 server configuration have been completed.
* A peering relationship exists between source and destination clusters, and a peering relationship exists between source and destination storage VMs.
* CA Certificates are needed for the source and destination VMs. You can use self-signed CA certificates or certificates signed by an external CA vendor.

. If this is the first SnapMirror S3 relationship for this storage VM, verify that root user keys exist for both source and destination storage VMs and regenerate them if they do not:
.. Click *Storage > Storage VMs* and then select the storage VM.
.. In the *Settings* tab, click image:icon_pencil.gif[Edit icon] in the *S3* tile.
.. In the *Users* tab, verify that there is an access key for the root user.
.. If there is not, click image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon] next to *root*, then click *Regenerate Key*.
Do not regenerate the key if one already exists.
. Edit the storage VM to add users, and to add users to groups, in both the source and destination storage VMs:
+
Click *Storage > storage VMs*, click the storage VM, click *Settings* and then click image:icon_pencil.gif[Edit icon] under S3.
+
See link:../task_object_provision_add_s3_users_groups.html[Add S3 users and groups] for more information.
+
. On the source cluster, create a SnapMirror S3 policy if you don’t have an existing one and you don’t want to use the default policy:

.. Click *Protection > Overview*, and then click *Local Policy Settings*.
.. Click image:../media/icon_arrow.gif[Arrow icon] next to *Protection Policies*, then click *Add*.
* Enter the policy name and description.
* Select the policy scope, cluster or SVM
* Select *Continuous* for SnapMirror S3 relationships.
* Enter your *Throttle* and *Recovery Point Objective* values.
. Create a bucket with SnapMirror protection:
.. Click *Storage > Buckets*, then click *Add*. Verifying permissions is optional but recommended.
.. Enter a name, select the storage VM, enter a size, then click *More Options*.
.. Under *Permissions*, click *Add*.
* *Principal* and *Effect* - select values corresponding to your user group settings or accept the defaults.
* *Actions*- make sure the following values are shown: 
+
----
GetObject,PutObject,DeleteObject,ListBucket,GetBucketAcl,GetObjectAcl,ListBucketMultipartUploads,ListMultipartUploadParts
----
+
* *Resources* - use the defaults `(_bucketname, bucketname_/*)` or other values you need.
+
See link:../task_object_provision_manage_bucket_access.html[Manage user access to buckets] for more information about these fields.
.. Under *Protection*, check *Enable SnapMirror (ONTAP or Cloud)*. Then enter the following values:
* Destination
** *TARGET: ONTAP System*
** *CLUSTER*: Select the remote cluster.
** *STORAGE VM*: Select a storage VM on the remote cluster.
** *S3 SERVER CA CERTIFICATE*: Copy and paste the contents of the _source_ certificate.
* Source
** *S3 SERVER CA CERTIFICATE:* Copy and paste the contents of the _destination_ certificate.
+
. Check *Use the same certificate on the destination* if you are using a certificate signed by an external CA vendor.
. If you click *Destination Settings*, you can also enter your own values in place of the defaults for bucket name, capacity, and performance service level.
. Click *Save*. A new bucket is created in the source storage VM, and it is mirrored to a new bucket that is created the destination storage VM.

. If this is the first SnapMirror S3 relationship for this SVM, verify that root user keys exist for both source and destination SVMs and regenerate them if they do not:
+
`vserver object-store-server user show`
+
Verify that there is an access key for the root user. If there is not, enter:
+
`vserver object-store-server user regenerate-keys -vserver svm_name -user _root_`
+
Do not regenerate the key if one already exists.
. Create buckets in both the source and destination SVMs:
+
`vserver object-store-server bucket create -vserver svm_name -bucket bucket_name [-size _integer_[KB|MB|GB|TB|PB]] [-comment _text_] [_additional_options_]`
+
. Add access rules to the default bucket policies in both the source and destination SVMs:
+
`vserver object-store-server bucket policy add-statement -vserver _svm_name_ -bucket _bucket_name_ -effect {allow|deny} -action _object_store_actions_ -principal _user_and_group_names_ -resource _object_store_resources_ [-sid _text_] [-index _integer_]`
+
.Example
----
src_cluster::> vserver object-store-server bucket policy add-statement -bucket test-bucket -effect allow -action GetObject,PutObject,DeleteObject,ListBucket,GetBucketAcl,GetObjectAcl,ListBucketMultipartUploads,ListMultipartUploadParts -principal - -resource test-bucket, test-bucket /*
----
+
. On the source SVM, create a SnapMirror S3 policy if you don't have an existing one and you don't want to use the default policy:
`snapmirror policy create -vserver _svm_name_ -policy policy_name -type continuous [-rpo _integer_] [-throttle _throttle_type_] [-comment _text_] [_additional_options_]`
+
Parameters:

* type `continuous` - the only policy type for SnapMirror S3 relationships (required).
* `-rpo` - specifies the time for recovery point objective, in seconds (optional).
* `-throttle` - specifies the upper limit on throughput/bandwidth, in kilobytes/seconds (optional).
+
.Example
+
----
src_cluster::> snapmirror policy create -vserver vs0 -type continuous -rpo 0 -policy test-policy
----
. Install CA server certificates on the admin SVMs of the source and destination clusters:
.. On the source cluster, install the CA certificate that signed the _destination_ S3 server certificate:
`security certificate install -type server-ca -vserver _src_admin_svm_ -cert-name _dest_server_certificate_`
.. On the destination cluster, install the CA certificate that signed the _source_ S3 server certificate:
`security certificate install -type server-ca -vserver _dest_admin_svm_ -cert-name _src_server_certificate_`
+
If you are using a certificate signed by an external CA vendor, install the same certificate on the source and destination admin SVM.
+
Learn more about `security certificate install` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/security-certificate-install.html[ONTAP command reference^].
. On the source SVM, create a SnapMirror S3 relationship:
+
`snapmirror create -source-path _src_svm_name_:/bucket/_bucket_name_ -destination-path _dest_peer_svm_name_:/bucket/_bucket_name_, ...} [-policy policy_name]`
+
You can use a policy you created or accept the default.
+
.Example
+
----
src_cluster::> snapmirror create -source-path vs0-src:/bucket/test-bucket -destination-path vs1-dest:bucket/test-bucket-mirror -policy test-policy
----
.	Verify that mirroring is active:
`snapmirror show -policy-type continuous -fields status`
