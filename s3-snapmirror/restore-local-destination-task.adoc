When data in a source bucket is lost or corrupted, you can repopulate your data by restoring objects from a destination bucket.

.About this task

You can restore the destination bucket to an existing bucket or a new bucket. The target bucket for the restore operation must be larger than the destination bucket;s logical used space.

If you use an existing bucket, it must be empty when starting a restore operation.  Restore does not "roll back" a bucket in time; rather, it populates an empty bucket with its previous contents.

The restore operation must be initiated from the local cluster.

. If you are restoring objects to a new bucket, create the new bucket. For more information, see link:create-cloud-backup-new-bucket-task.html[Create a backup relationship for a new bucket (cloud target)].
. Initiate a restore operation for the destination bucket:
`snapmirror restore -source-path _svm_name_:/bucket/_bucket_name_ -destination-path _svm_name_:/bucket/_bucket_name_`
