When data in a source bucket is lost or corrupted, you can repopulate your data by restoring objects from a destination bucket.

.About this task

You can restore the destination bucket to an existing bucket or a new bucket. The target bucket for the restore operation must be larger than the destination bucket;s logical used space.

If you use an existing bucket, it must be empty when starting a restore operation.  Restore does not "roll back" a bucket in time; rather, it populates an empty bucket with its previous contents.

The restore operation must be initiated from the local cluster.

* To restore to an *Existing Bucket* (the default), complete these actions:
** Select the cluster and storage VM to search for the existing bucket.
** Select the existing bucket.
. Copy and paste the contents of the destination S3 server CA certificate.
* To restore to a *New Bucket*, enter the following values:
** The cluster and storage VM to host the new bucket.
** The new bucket's name, capacity, and performance service level.
See link:../s3-config/storage-service-definitions-reference.html[Storage service levels] for more information.

. If you are restoring objects to a new bucket, create the new bucket. For more information, see link:create-cloud-backup-new-bucket-task.html[Create a cloud backup relationship for a new ONTAP S3 bucket].
. Initiate a restore operation for the destination bucket:
`snapmirror restore -source-path _svm_name_:/bucket/_bucket_name_ -destination-path _svm_name_:/bucket/_bucket_name_`
