If the data in a source bucket becomes unavailable, you can break the SnapMirror relationship to make the destination bucket writable and begin serving data.

.About this task

When a takeover operation is performed, source bucket is converted to read-only and original destination bucket is converted to read-write, thereby reversing the SnapMirror S3 relationship.

When the disabled source bucket is available again, SnapMirror S3 automatically resynchronizes the contents of the two buckets. You donâ€™t need to explicitly resynchronize the relationship, as is required for standard volume SnapMirror deployments.

If the destination bucket is on a remote cluster, the takeover operation must be initiated from the remote cluster.
