When you create new S3 buckets, you can protect them immediately to an S3 SnapMirror destination on the same cluster. You can mirror data to a bucket in a different storage VM or the same storage VM as the source.

.What you'll need

* Requirements for ONTAP versions, licensing, and S3 server configuration have been completed.
* A peering relationship exists between source and destination storage VMs.
* CA Certificates are needed for the source and destination VMs. You can use self-signed CA certificates or certificates signed by an external CA vendor.



== System Manager procedure

. If this is the first S3 SnapMirror relationship for this storage VM, verify that root user keys exist for both source and destination storage VMs and regenerate them if they do not:
.. Click *Storage > Storage VMs* and then select the storage VM.
.. In the *Settings* tab, click image:icon_pencil.gif[edit icon] in the S3 tile.
.. In the *Users* tab, verify that there is an access key for the root user
.. If there is not, click image:icon_kabob.gif[more icon] next to *root*, then click *Regenerate Key*.
Do not regenerate the key if one already exists.
. Edit the storage VM to add users, and to add users to groups, in both the source and destination storage VMs:
Click *Storage > storage VMs*, click the storage VM, click *Settings* and then click image:icon_pencil.gif[edit icon] under S3.
+
See link:../task_object_provision_add_s3_users_groups.html[Add S3 users and groups] for more information.
. Create an S3 SnapMirror policy if you don’t have an existing one and you don’t want to use the default policy:
.. Click *Protection > Overview*, and then click *Local Policy Settings*.
.. Click image:../media/icon_arrow.gif[right arrow] next to *Protection Policies*, then click *Add*.
* Enter the policy name and description.
* Select the policy scope, cluster or SVM
* Select *Continuous* for S3 SnapMirror relationships.
* Enter your *Throttle* and *Recovery Point Objective* values.
. Create a bucket with SnapMirror protection:
.. Click *Storage > Buckets* then click *Add*.
.. Enter a name, select the storage VM, enter a size, then click *More Options*.
.. Under *Permissions*, click *Add*. Verifying permissions is optional but recommended.
* *Principal* and *Effect* - select values corresponding to your user group settings, or accept the defaults.
* *Actions* - make sure the following values are shown: 
+
----
GetObject,PutObject,DeleteObject,ListBucket,GetBucketAcl,GetObjectAcl,ListBucketMultipartUploads,ListMultipartUploadParts
----
+
* *Resources* - use the defaults ``(bucketname, bucketname/*)`` or other values you need
+
See link:../task_object_provision_manage_bucket_access.html[Manage user access to buckets] for more information about these fields.
.. Under *Protection*, check *Enable SnapMirror (ONTAP or Cloud)*. Then enter the following values:
* Destination
** *TARGET*: ONTAP System
** *CLUSTER*: Select the local cluster.
** *STORAGE VM*: Select a storage VM on the local cluster.
** *S3 SERVER CA CERTIFICATE*: Copy and paste the contents of the source certificate.
* Source
** *S3 SERVER CA CERTIFICATE*: Copy and paste the contents of the destination certificate.
. Check *Use the same certificate on the destination* if you are using a certificate signed by an external CA vendor.
. If you click *Destination Settings*, you can also enter your own values in place of the defaults for bucket name, capacity, and performance service level.
. Click *Save*. A new bucket is created in the source storage VM, and it is mirrored to a new bucket that is created the destination storage VM.

== CLI procedure

. If this is the first S3 SnapMirror relationship for this SVM, verify that root user keys exist for both source and destination SVMs and regenerate them if they do not:
`vserver object-store-server user show`
+
Verify that there is an access key for the root user. If there is not, enter:
`vserver object-store-server user regenerate-keys -vserver _svm_name_ -user _root_`
+
Do not regenerate the key if one already exists.
. Create buckets in both the source and destination SVMs:
+
`vserver object-store-server bucket create -vserver svm_name -bucket bucket_name [-size _integer_[KB|MB|GB|TB|PB]] [-comment _text_] [_additional_options_]`
+
. Add access rules to the default bucket policies in both the source and destination SVMs:
+
`vserver object-store-server bucket policy add-statement -vserver _svm_name_ -bucket _bucket_name_ -effect {allow|deny} -action _object_store_actions_ -principal _user_and_group_names_ -resource _object_store_resources_ [-sid _text_] [-index _integer_]`
+
.Example
....
src_cluster::> vserver object-store-server bucket policy add-statement -bucket test-bucket -effect allow -action GetObject,PutObject,DeleteObject,ListBucket,GetBucketAcl,GetObjectAcl,ListBucketMultipartUploads,ListMultipartUploadParts -principal - -resource test-bucket, test-bucket /*
....

. Create an S3 SnapMirror policy if you don’t have an existing one and you don’t want to use the default policy:
`snapmirror policy create -vserver svm_name -policy policy_name -type continuous [-rpo _integer_] [-throttle _throttle_type_] [-comment _text_] [_additional_options_]`
+
Parameters:

* `continuous` – the only policy type for S3 SnapMirror relationships (required).
* `-rpo` – specifies the time for recovery point objective, in seconds (optional).
* `-throttle` – specifies the upper limit on throughput/bandwidth, in kilobytes/seconds (optional).
+
.Example
+
----
src_cluster::> snapmirror policy create -vserver vs0 -type continuous -rpo 0 -policy test-policy
----
. Install CA server certificates on the admin SVM:
.. Install the CA certificate that signed the _source_ S3 server’s certificate on the admin SVM:
`security certificate install -type server-ca -vserver _admin_svm_ -cert-name _src_server_certificate_`
.. Install the CA certificate that signed the _destination_ S3 server’s certificate on the admin SVM:
`security certificate install -type server-ca -vserver _admin_svm_ -cert-name _dest_server_certificate_`
 +
If you are using a certificate signed by an external CA vendor, you only need to install this certificate on the admin SVM.
+
See the `security certificate install` man page for details.
. Create an S3 SnapMirror relationship:
`snapmirror create -source-path _src_svm_name_:/bucket/_bucket_name_ -destination-path _dest_peer_svm_name_:/bucket/_bucket_name_, ...} [-policy policy_name]``
+
You can use a policy you created or accept the default.
+
.Example
+
....
src_cluster::> snapmirror create -source-path vs0-src:/bucket/test-bucket -destination-path vs1-dest:/vs1/bucket/test-bucket-mirror -policy test-policy
....
. Verify that mirroring is active:
`snapmirror show -policy-type continuous -fields status`
