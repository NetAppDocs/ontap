If the data in a source bucket becomes unavailable, you can break the SnapMirror relationship to make the destination bucket writable and begin serving data.

.About this task

When a takeover operation is performed, source bucket is converted to read-only and original destination bucket is converted to read-write, thereby reversing the S3 SnapMirror relationship.

When the disabled source bucket is available again, S3 SnapMirror automatically resynchronizes the contents of the two buckets. It is not necessary to explicitly resynchronize the relationship, as is required for volume SnapMirror deployments.

The takeover operation must be initiated from the remote cluster.
