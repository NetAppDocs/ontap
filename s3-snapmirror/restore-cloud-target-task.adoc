When data in a source bucket is lost or corrupted, you can repopulate your data by restoring from a destination bucket.

.About this task

You can restore the destination bucket to an existing bucket or a new bucket. The target bucket for the restore operation must be larger than the destination bucket’s logical used space.

If you use an existing bucket, it must be empty when starting a restore operation.  Restore does not "roll back" a bucket in time; rather, it populates an empty bucket with its previous contents.
