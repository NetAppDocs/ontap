summary: You can begin protecting existing S3 buckets on the same cluster at any time; for example, if you upgraded an S3 configuration from a release earlier than ONTAP 9.10.1. You can mirror data to a bucket in a different storage VM or the same storage VM as the source.

You can begin protecting existing S3 buckets on the same cluster at any time; for example, if you upgraded an S3 configuration from a release earlier than ONTAP 9.10.1. You can mirror data to a bucket in a different storage VM or the same storage VM as the source.

.Before you begin

* Requirements for ONTAP versions, licensing, and S3 server configuration have been completed.
* A peering relationship exists between source and destination storage VMs.
* CA Certificates are needed for the source and destination VMs. You can use self-signed CA certificates or certificates signed by an external CA vendor.

. If this is the first SnapMirror S3 relationship for this storage VM, verify that root user keys exist for both source and destination storage VMs and regenerate them if they do not:
.. Click *Storage > Storage VMs* and then select the storage VM.
.. In the *Settings* tab, click image:icon_pencil.gif[Edit icon] in the *S3* tile.
.. In the *Users* tab, verify that there is an access key for the root user.
.. If there is not, click image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon] next to *root*, then click *Regenerate Key*.
Do not regenerate the key if one already exists
. Verify that existing users and groups are present and have the correct access in both the source and destination storage VMs:
Select *Storage > Storage VMs,* then select the storage VM, and then *Settings* tab. Finally, locate the *S3* tile, select image:icon_pencil.gif[Edit icon], and select the *Users* tab and then the *Groups* tab to view user and group access settings.
+
See link:../task_object_provision_add_s3_users_groups.html[Add S3 users and groups] for more information.
. Create a SnapMirror S3 policy if you don’t have an existing one and you don’t want to use the default policy:
.. Click *Protection > Overview*, and then click *Local Policy Setting*.
.. Click image:../media/icon_arrow.gif[Arrow icon] next to *Protection Policies*, then click *Add*.
* Enter the policy name and description.
* Select the policy scope, cluster or SVM
* Select *Continuous* for SnapMirror S3 relationships.
* Enter your *Throttle* and *Recovery Point Objective* values.
. Verify that the bucket access policy of the existing bucket continues to meet your needs:
.. Click *Storage > Buckets* and then select the bucket you want to protect.
.. In the *Permissions* tab, click image:icon_pencil.gif[Edit icon] *Edit*, then click *Add* under *Permissions*.
* *Principal* and *Effect* - select values corresponding to your user group settings, or accept the defaults.
* *Actions* - make sure the following values are shown: 
+
----
GetObject,PutObject,DeleteObject,ListBucket,GetBucketAcl,GetObjectAcl,ListBucketMultipartUploads,ListMultipartUploadParts
----
+
* *Resources* - use the defaults `_(bucketname, bucketname/*)_` or other values you need.
+
See link:../task_object_provision_manage_bucket_access.html[Manage user access to buckets] for more information about these fields.
. Protect an existing bucket with SnapMirror S3:
.. Click *Storage* > *Buckets* and then select the bucket you want to protect.
.. Click *Protect* and enter the following values:
* Destination
** *TARGET*: ONTAP System
** *CLUSTER*: Select the local cluster.
** *STORAGE VM*: Select the same or a different storage VM.
** *S3 SERVER CA CERTIFICATE*: Copy and paste the contents of the _source_ certificate.
* Source
** *S3 SERVER CA CERTIFICATE*: Copy and paste the contents of the _destination_ certificate.
. Check *Use the same certificate on the destination* if you are using a certificate signed by an external CA vendor.
. If you click *Destination Settings*, you can also enter your own values in place of the defaults for bucket name, capacity, and performance service level.
. Click *Save*. The existing bucket is mirrored to a new bucket in the destination storage VM.

. If this is the first SnapMirror S3 relationship for this SVM, verify that root user keys exist for both source and destination SVMs and regenerate them if they do not:
`vserver object-store-server user show`
+
Verify that there is an access key for the root user. If there is not, enter:
`vserver object-store-server user regenerate-keys -vserver _svm_name_ -user _root_`
+
Do not regenerate the key if one already exists.
. Create a bucket on the destination SVM to be the mirror target:
+
`vserver object-store-server bucket create -vserver _svm_name_ -bucket _dest_bucket_name_ [-size _integer_[KB|MB|GB|TB|PB]] [-comment _text_] [_additional_options_]`
+
. Verify that the access rules to the default bucket policies are correct in both the source and destination SVMs:
+
`vserver object-store-server bucket policy add-statement -vserver _svm_name_ -bucket _bucket_name_ -effect {allow|deny} -action _object_store_actions_ -principal _user_and_group_names_ -resource _object_store_resources_ [-sid _text_] [-index _integer_]``
+
.Example
+
----
clusterA::> vserver object-store-server bucket policy add-statement -bucket test-bucket -effect allow -action GetObject,PutObject,DeleteObject,ListBucket,GetBucketAcl,GetObjectAcl,ListBucketMultipartUploads,ListMultipartUploadParts -principal - -resource test-bucket, test-bucket /*
----
. Create a SnapMirror S3 policy if you don’t have an existing one and you don’t want to use the default policy:
+
`snapmirror policy create -vserver _svm_name_ -policy _policy_name -type continuous [-rpo _integer_] [-throttle _throttle_type_] [-comment text] [_additional_options_]`
+
Parameters:
+
* `continuous` – the only policy type for SnapMirror S3 relationships (required).
* `-rpo` – specifies the time for recovery point objective, in seconds (optional).
* `-throttle` – specifies the upper limit on throughput/bandwidth, in kilobytes/seconds (optional).
+
.Example
+
----
clusterA::> snapmirror policy create -vserver vs0 -type continuous -rpo 0 -policy test-policy
----
. Install CA server certificates on the admin SVM:
.. Install the CA certificate that signed the _source_ S3 server’s certificate on the admin SVM:
`security certificate install -type server-ca -vserver _admin_svm_ -cert-name _src_server_certificate_`
.. Install the CA certificate that signed the _destination_ S3 server’s certificate on the admin SVM:
`security certificate install -type server-ca -vserver _admin_svm_ -cert-name _dest_server_certificate_`
 +
If you are using a certificate signed by an external CA vendor, you only need to install this certificate on the admin SVM.
+
Learn more about `security certificate install` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/security-certificate-install.html[ONTAP command reference^].
. Create a SnapMirror S3 relationship:
`snapmirror create -source-path _src_svm_name_:/bucket/_bucket_name_ -destination-path _dest_peer_svm_name_:/bucket/_bucket_name_, ...} [-policy policy_name]`
+
You can use a policy you created or accept the default.
+
.Example
+
----
src_cluster::> snapmirror create -source-path vs0-src:/bucket/test-bucket -destination-path vs1-dest:/bucket/test-bucket-mirror -policy test-policy
----
. Verify that mirroring is active:
`snapmirror show -policy-type continuous -fields status`
