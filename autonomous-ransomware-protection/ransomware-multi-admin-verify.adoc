This is another native built-in ONTAP solution for protecting unauthorized access to your data.

MAV has a robust set of capabilities that ensure certain operations, such as deleting volumes, creating additional administrative users, or deleting Snapshot copies, can be executed only after approvals from at least a second designated administrator. This prevents compromised, malicious, or inexperienced administrators from making undesirable changes or deleting data.

You can configure as many designated administrators’ approvers as you want before a Snapshot copy can be deleted. MAV is an excellent built-in tool that prevents unwanted access to data.

MAV is included in all ONTAP licenses. To learn more about MAV and how to configure its protection capabilities see the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/multi-admin-verify/index.html[Multi-admin verification overview^].
