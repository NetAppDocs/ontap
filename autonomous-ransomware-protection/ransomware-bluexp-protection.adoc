It is important for ransomware detection to occur as early as possible so that you can prevent the spread and avoid costly downtime. An effective ransomware detection strategy, however, should include more than a single layer of protection. NetApp's ransomware protection takes a comprehensive approach that includes on-box capabilities extending to data services using BlueXP and an isolated, layered solution for cyber vaulting.

== BlueXP ransomware protection
BlueXP is a single control plane to intelligently orchestrate a comprehensive, workload-centric ransomware defense. BlueXP ransomware protection brings together the powerful cyber-resilience features of ONTAP, such as ARP, FPolicy, and tamperproof snapshots, and BlueXP data services, such as BlueXP backup and recovery. It also adds recommendations and guidance with automated workflows to provide an end-to-end defense through a single UI. It operates at the workload level to ensure that the applications that run your business are protected and can be recovered as quickly as possible in case of an attack.
