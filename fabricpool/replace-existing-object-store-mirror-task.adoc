[.lead]
You can use FabricPool mirror technology to replace one object store with another one. The new object store does not have to use the same cloud provider as the original object store.

.About this task

You can replace the original object store with an object store that uses a different cloud provider. For instance, your original object store might use AWS as the cloud provider, but you can replace it with an object store that uses Azure as the cloud provider, and vice versa. However, the new object store must retain the same object size as the original.

.Steps

. Create a FabricPool mirror by adding a new object store to an existing FabricPool using the `storage aggregate object-store mirror` command.

----
cluster1::> storage aggregate object-store mirror -aggregate aggr1 -object-store-name my-AZURE-store
----

. Monitor the mirror resync status using the `storage aggregate object-store show-resync-status` command.
+
----
cluster1::> storage aggregate object-store show-resync-status -aggregate aggr1

      Aggregate    Primary          Mirror        Percentage
      ---------    -----------      ----------    ----------
      aggr1        my-AWS-store     my-AZURE-store     40%
----

. Verify the mirror is in sync using the `storage aggregate object-store> show -fields mirror-type,is-mirror-degraded` command.

cluster1::> storage aggregate object-store show -fields mirror-type,is-mirror-degraded

aggregate      object-store-name mirror-type     is-mirror-degraded

aggr1          my-AWS-store        primary           -
               my-AZURE-store      mirror          false
----

. Swap the primary object store with the mirror object store using the `storage aggregate object-store modify` command.
+
----
cluster1::> storage aggregate object-store modify -aggregate aggr1 -object-store-name my-AZURE-store -mirror-type primary
----

. Display details about the FabricPool mirror using the `storage aggregate object-store show -fields mirror-type,is-mirror-degraded` command.
+
This example displays the information about the FabricPool mirror, including whether the mirror is degraded (not in sync).

               my-AWS-store        mirror          false
----

. Remove the FabricPool mirror using the `storage aggregate object-store unmirror` command.
+
----
cluster1::> storage aggregate object-store unmirror -aggregate aggr1
----

. Verify that the FabricPool is back in a single object store configuration using the `storage aggregate object-store show -fields mirror-type,is-mirror-degraded` command.
