[.lead]
Seeing how much data in a volume is inactive enables you to make good use of storage tiers. Information in inactive data reporting helps you decide which aggregate to use for FabricPool, whether to move a volume in to or out of FabricPool, or whether to modify the tiering policy of a volume.

.What you'll need

You must be running ONTAP 9.4 or later to use the inactive data reporting functionality.

.About this task

* Inactive data reporting is not supported on some aggregates.
+
You cannot enable inactive data reporting when FabricPool cannot be enabled, including the following instances:

 ** Root aggregates
 ** MetroCluster aggregates running ONTAP versions earlier than 9.7
 ** Flash Pool (hybrid aggregates, or SnapLock aggregates)

* Inactive data reporting is enabled by default on aggregates where any volumes have adaptive compression enabled.
* Inactive data reporting is enabled by default on all SSD aggregates in ONTAP 9.6.
* Inactive data reporting is enabled by default on FabricPool aggregate in ONTAP 9.4 and ONTAP 9.5.
* You can enable inactive data reporting on non-FabricPool aggregates using the ONTAP CLI, including HDD aggregates, beginning with ONTAP 9.6.

== Procedure

You can determine how much data is inactive with ONTAP System Manager or the ONTAP CLI.

.System Manager
--
. Choose one of the following options:
* When you have existing HDD aggregates, navigate to *Storage > Tiers* and click image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon] for the aggregate on which you want to enable inactive data reporting.
* When no cloud tiers are configured, navigate to *Dashboard* and click the *Enable inactive data reporting* link under *Capacity*.

.CLI
--
.To enable inactive data reporting with the CLI:
. If the aggregate for which you want to see inactive data reporting is not used in FabricPool, enable inactive data reporting for the aggregate by using the `storage aggregate modify` command with the `-is-inactive-data-reporting-enabled` `true` parameter.
+
----
cluster1::> storage aggregate modify -aggregate aggr1 -is-inactive-data-reporting-enabled true
----
+
You need to explicitly enable the inactive data reporting functionality on an aggregate that is not used for FabricPool.
+
You cannot and do not need to enable inactive data reporting on a FabricPool-enabled aggregate because the aggregate already comes with inactive data reporting. The `-is-inactive-data-reporting-enabled` parameter does not work on FabricPool-enabled aggregates.
+
The `-fields is-inactive-data-reporting-enabled` parameter of the `storage aggregate show` command shows whether inactive data reporting is enabled on an aggregate.

. To display how much data is inactive on a volume, use the `volume show` command with the `-fields performance-tier-inactive-user-data,performance-tier-inactive-user-data-percent` parameter.
+
----
cluster1::> volume show -fields performance-tier-inactive-user-data,performance-tier-inactive-user-data-percent

vserver volume performance-tier-inactive-user-data performance-tier-inactive-user-data-percent
------- ------ ----------------------------------- -------------------------------------------

 ** The `performance-tier-inactive-user-data` field displays how much user data stored in the aggregate is inactive.
 ** The `performance-tier-inactive-user-data-percent` field displays what percent of the data is inactive across the active file system and Snapshot copies.
 ** For an aggregate that is not used for FabricPool, inactive data reporting uses the tiering policy to decide how much data to report as cold.
  *** For the `none` tiering policy, 31 days is used.
  *** For the `snapshot-only` and `auto`, inactive data reporting uses `tiering-minimum-cooling-days`.
  *** For the `ALL` policy, inactive data reporting assumes the data will tier within a day.
+
Until the period is reached, the output shows "`-`" for the amount of inactive data instead of a value.

 ** On a volume that is part of FabricPool, what ONTAP reports as inactive depends on the tiering policy that is set on a volume.
  *** For the `none` tiering policy, ONTAP reports the amount of the entire volume that is inactive for at least 31 days. You cannot use the `-tiering-minimum-cooling-days` parameter with the `none` tiering policy.
  *** For the `ALL`, `snapshot-only`, and `auto` tiering policies, inactive data reporting is not supported.
