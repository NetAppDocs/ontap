To create a FabricPool mirror, you attach two object stores to a single FabricPool. You can create a FabricPool mirror either by attaching a second object store to an existing, single object store FabricPool configuration, or you can create a new, single object store FabricPool configuration and then attach a second object store to it. You can also create FabricPool mirrors on MetroCluster configurations.

.What you'll need

* You must have already created the two object stores using the `storage aggregate object-store config` command.
* If you are creating FabricPool mirrors on MetroCluster configurations:
 ** You must have already set up and configured the MetroCluster
 ** You must have created the object store configurations on the selected cluster.
+
If you are creating FabricPool mirrors on both clusters in a MetroCluster configuration, you must have created object store configurations on both of the clusters.

 ** If you are not using on premises object stores for MetroCluster configurations, you should ensure that one of the following scenarios exists:
  *** Object stores are in different availability zones
  *** Object stores are configured to keep copies of objects in multiple availability zones

.About this task

The object store you use for the FabricPool mirror must be different from the primary object store.

The procedure for creating a FabricPool mirror is the same for both MetroCluster and non-MetroCluster configurations.

.Steps

. If you are not using an existing FabricPool configuration, create a new one by attaching an object store to an aggregate using the `storage aggregate object-store attach` command.
+
This example creates a new FabricPool by attaching an object store to an aggregate.

cluster1::> storage aggregate object-store attach -aggregate aggr1 -name my-store-1

. Attach a second object store to the aggregate using the `storage aggregate object-store mirror` command.
+
This example attaches a second object store to an aggregate to create a FabricPool mirror.
