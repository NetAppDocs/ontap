[.lead]
If you are running ONTAP 9.2 or later, you can set up StorageGRID as the cloud tier for FabricPool. When tiering data that is accessed by SAN protocols, NetApp recommends using private clouds, like StorageGRID, due to connectivity considerations.

.Considerations for using StorageGRID with FabricPool

* You need to install a CA certificate for StorageGRID, unless you explicitly disable certificate checking.
* You must not enable StorageGRID object versioning on the object store bucket.
* A FabricPool license is not required.
* If a StorageGRID node is deployed in a virtual machine with storage assigned from a NetApp AFF system, confirm that the volume does not have a FabricPool tiering policy enabled.
+
Disabling FabricPool tiering for volumes used with StorageGRID nodes simplifies troubleshooting and storage operations.
+
[NOTE]
====
Never use FabricPool to tier any data related to StorageGRID back to StorageGRID itself. Tiering StorageGRID data back to StorageGRID increases troubleshooting and operational complexity.
====

.About this task

Load balancing is enabled for StorageGRID in ONTAP 9.8 and later. When the server's hostname resolves to more than one IP address, ONTAP establishes client connections with all the IP addresses returned (up to a maximum of 16 IP addresses). The IP addresses are picked up in a round-robin method when connections are established.

.Procedures

You can set up StorageGRID as the cloud tier for FabricPool with ONTAP System Manager or the ONTAP CLI.

.System Manager
--

. Click *Storage > Tiers > Add Cloud Tier* and select StorageGRID as the object store provider.
. Complete the requested information.
. If you want to create a cloud mirror, click *Add as FabricPool Mirror*.

A FabricPool mirror provides a method for you to seamlessly replace a data store, and it helps to ensure that your data is available in the event of disaster.
--

.CLI
--
. Specify the StorageGRID configuration information by using the `storage aggregate object-store config create` command with the `-provider-type` `SGWS` parameter.
 ** The `storage aggregate object-store config create` command fails if ONTAP cannot access StorageGRID with the provided information.
 ** You use the `-access-key` parameter to specify the access key for authorizing requests to the StorageGRID object store.
 ** You use the `-secret-password` parameter to specify the password (secret access key) for authenticating requests to the StorageGRID object store.
 ** If the StorageGRID password is changed, you should update the corresponding password stored in ONTAP immediately.
+
Doing so enables ONTAP to access the data in StorageGRID without interruption.

 ** Setting the `-is-certificate-validation-enabled` parameter to `false` disables certificate checking for StorageGRID. Using signed certificates (`-is-certificate-validation-enabled true`) from a third-party certificate authority is a recommended best practice.

. Display and verify the StorageGRID configuration information by using the `storage aggregate object-store config show` command.

The `storage aggregate object-store config modify` command enables you to modify the StorageGRID configuration information for FabricPool.
