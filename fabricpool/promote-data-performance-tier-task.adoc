[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, if you are a cluster administrator at the advanced privilege level, you can proactively promote data to the performance tier from the cloud tier using a combination of the `tiering-policy` and the `cloud-retrieval-policy` setting.

.About this task

You might do this if you want to stop using FabricPool on a volume, or if you have a `snapshot-only` tiering policy and you want to bring restored Snapshot copy data back to the performance tier.

== Promote all data from a FabricPool volume to the performance tier

You can proactively retrieve all data on a FabricPool volume in the cloud tier and promote it to the performance tier.

.Steps
. Use the `volume modify` command to set `tiering-policy` to `none` and `cloud-retrieval-policy` to `promote`.
+
----
volume modify -vserver <vserver-name> -volume <volume-name> -tiering-policy none -cloud-retrieval-policy promote
----

== Promote file system data to the performance tier

You can proactively retrieve active file system data from a restored Snapshot copy in the cloud tier and promote it to the performance tier.

.Steps
. Use the `volume modify` command to set `tiering-policy` to `snapshot-only` and `cloud-retrieval-policy` to `promote`.
+
----
volume modify -vserver <vserver-name> -volume <volume-name> -tiering-policy snapshot-only cloud-retrieval-policy promote
----

== Check the status of a performance tier promotion

You can check the status of performance tier promotion to determine when the operation is complete.

.Steps
. Use the volume `object-store` command with the `tiering` option to check the status of the performance tier promotion.

== Trigger scheduled migration and tiering

Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can trigger a tiering scan request at any time when you prefer not to wait for the default tiering scan.

.Steps
. Use the `volume object-store` command with the `trigger` option to request migration and tiering.
