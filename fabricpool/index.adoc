You can use FabricPool to automatically tier data depending on how frequently the data is accessed.

FabricPool is a hybrid storage solution that uses an all flash (all SSD) aggregate as the performance tier and an object store as the cloud tier. Using a FabricPool helps you reduce storage cost without compromising performance, efficiency, or protection.

The cloud tier can be located on NetApp StorageGRID or ONTAP S3 (beginning with ONTAP 9.8), or one of the following service providers:

* Alibaba cloud

* Amazon S3

* Amazon Commercial Cloud Services

* Google Cloud

* IBM cloud

* Microsoft Azure Blob Storage

[NOTE]
====
Beginning with ONTAP 9.7, additional object store providers that support generic S3 APIs can be used by selecting the S3_Compatible object store provider.
