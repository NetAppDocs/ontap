[.lead]
If you are running ONTAP 9.4 or later, you can set up Azure Blob Storage for the cloud as the cloud tier for FabricPool.

.Considerations for using Microsoft Azure Blob Storage with FabricPool

* A link:https://bluexp.netapp.com/cloud-tiering[BlueXP tiering license] is required when tiering to Azure Blob Storage.

* A FabricPool license is not required if you are using Azure Blob Storage with Cloud Volumes ONTAP.
* It is recommended that the LIF that ONTAP uses to connect with the Azure Blob Storage object server be on a 10 Gbps port.
* FabricPool currently does not support Azure Stack, which is on-premises Azure services.
* At the account level in Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, FabricPool supports only hot and cool storage tiers.
+
FabricPool does not support blob-level tiering. It also does not support tiering to Azure's archive storage tier.

.About this task

FabricPool currently does not support Azure Stack, which is on-premises Azure services.

.Steps

. Specify the Azure Blob Storage configuration information by using the `storage aggregate object-store config create` command with the `-provider-type` `Azure_Cloud` parameter.
 ** The `storage aggregate object-store config create` command fails if ONTAP cannot access Azure Blob Storage with the provided information.
 ** You use the `-azure-account` parameter to specify the Azure Blob Storage account.
 ** You use the `-azure-private-key` parameter to specify the access key for authenticating requests to Azure Blob Storage.
 ** If the Azure Blob Storage password is changed, you should update the corresponding password stored in ONTAP immediately.
+
Doing so enables ONTAP to access the data in Azure Blob Storage without interruption.

. Display and verify the Azure Blob Storage configuration information by using the `storage aggregate object-store config show` command.

The `storage aggregate object-store config modify` command enables you to modify the Azure Blob Storage configuration information for FabricPool.
