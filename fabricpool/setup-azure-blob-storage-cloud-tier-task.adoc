[.lead]
If you are running ONTAP 9.4 or later, you can set up Azure Blob Storage as the cloud tier for FabricPool.

.Considerations for using Microsoft Azure Blob Storage with FabricPool

* A link:https://bluexp.netapp.com/cloud-tiering[BlueXP tiering license] is required when tiering to Azure Blob Storage.

* A FabricPool license is not required if you are using Azure Blob Storage with Cloud Volumes ONTAP.
* It is recommended that the LIF that ONTAP uses to connect with the Azure Blob Storage object server be on a 10 Gbps port.
* FabricPool currently does not support Azure Stack, which is on-premises Azure services.
* At the account level in Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, FabricPool supports only hot and cool storage tiers.
+
FabricPool does not support blob-level tiering. It also does not support tiering to Azure's archive storage tier.

.About this task

FabricPool currently does not support Azure Stack, which is on-premises Azure services.

.Steps

. Specify the Azure Blob Storage configuration information by using the `storage aggregate object-store config create` command with the `-provider-type` `Azure_Cloud` parameter.
 ** The `storage aggregate object-store config create` command fails if ONTAP cannot access Azure Blob Storage with the provided information.
 ** You use the `-azure-account` parameter to specify the Azure Blob Storage account.
 ** You use the `-azure-private-key` parameter to specify the access key for authenticating requests to Azure Blob Storage.
 ** If the Azure Blob Storage password is changed, you should update the corresponding password stored in ONTAP immediately.
+
Doing so enables ONTAP to access the data in Azure Blob Storage without interruption.

. Display and verify the Azure Blob Storage configuration information by using the `storage aggregate object-store config show` command.

The `storage aggregate object-store config modify` command enables you to modify the Azure Blob Storage configuration information for FabricPool.
