= Attach the cloud tier to a local tier (aggregate)

[.lead]
After setting up an object store as the cloud tier, you specify the local tier (aggregate) to use by attaching it to FabricPool. In ONTAP 9.5 and later, you can also attach local tiers (aggregates) that contain qualified FlexGroup volume constituents.

.About this task

Attaching a cloud tier to a local tier is a permanent action. A cloud tier cannot be unattached from a local tier after being attached. However, you can use link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/fabricpool/create-mirror-task.html[FabricPool mirror] to attach a local tier to a different cloud tier.

.Before you begin

When you use the ONTAP CLI to set up an aggregate for FabricPool, the aggregate must already exist.

[NOTE]
====
When you use System Manager to set up a local tier for FabricPool, you can create the local tier and set it up to use for FabricPool at the same time.
====

.Steps

You can attach a local tier (aggregate) to a FabricPool object store with ONTAP System Manager or the ONTAP CLI.

.System Manager
--

. Navigate to *Storage > Tiers*, select a cloud tier, then click image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon].
. Select *Attach local tiers*.
. Under *Add as Primary* verify that the volumes are eligible to attach. 
. If necessary, select *Convert volumes to thin provisioned*.
. Click *Save*.

.CLI
--
.To attach an object store to an aggregate with the CLI:
. *Optional*: To see how much data in a volume is inactive, follow the steps in link:determine-data-inactive-reporting-task.html[Determining how much data in a volume is inactive by using inactive data reporting].
+
Seeing how much data in a volume is inactive can help you decide which aggregate to use for FabricPool.

. Attach the object store to an aggregate by using the `storage aggregate object-store attach` command.
+
If the aggregate has never been used with FabricPool and it contains existing volumes, then the volumes are assigned the default `snapshot-only` tiering policy.

-object-store-name Amazon01B1
----
+
You can use the `allow-flexgroup` `true` option to attach aggregates that contain FlexGroup volume constituents.

. Display the object store information and verify that the attached object store is available by using the `storage aggregate object-store show` command.
