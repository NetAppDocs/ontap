You need to know how much data is stored in the performance and cloud tiers for FabricPool. That information helps you determine whether you need to change the tiering policy of a volume, increase the FabricPool licensed usage limit, or increase the storage space of the cloud tier.

.Steps

. Monitor the space utilization for FabricPool-enabled aggregates by using one of the following commands to display the information:
+

|===

h| If you want to display... h| Then use this command:
a|
The used size of the cloud tier in an aggregate
a|
`storage aggregate show` with the `-instance` parameter
a|
Details of space utilization within an aggregate, including the object store's referenced capacity
a|
`storage aggregate show-space` with the `-instance` parameter
a|
Space utilization of the object stores that are attached to the aggregates, including how much license space is being used
a|
`storage aggregate object-store show-space`
a|
A list of volumes in an aggregate and the footprints of their data and metadata
a|
`volume show-footprint`
|===
In addition to using CLI commands, you can use Active IQ Unified Manager (formerly OnCommand Unified Manager), along with FabricPool Advisor, which is supported on ONTAP 9.4 and later clusters, or System Manager to monitor the space utilization.

The following example shows ways of displaying space utilization and related information for FabricPool:
