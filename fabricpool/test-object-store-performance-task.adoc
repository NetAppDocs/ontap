Before you attach an object store to a local tier, you can test the object store's latency and throughput performance by using object store profiler.

[NOTE]
====
Object store profiler results are a measurement of connectivity between ONTAP and the cloud tier object store using 4MB PUTs and random-read byte-ranged GETs ranging from 4MB to 256KB. (Only internal ONTAP features, such as SnapMirror, can make use of GETs larger than 32KB.)

Because they do not account for competing workloads or unique client application behavior, object store profiler results are not a perfect indicator of tiering performance.  
====

.Before you begin

* You must add the cloud tier to ONTAP before you can use it with the object store profiler. 
* You must be at the ONTAP CLI advanced privilege mode.

.Steps

. Start the object store profiler: 
+
`storage aggregate object-store profiler start -object-store-name <name> -node <name>`
. View the results:
+
`storage aggregate object-store profiler show`
