Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can enable and disable writing directly to the cloud on a new or existing volume in a FabricPool to allow NFS clients to write data directly to the cloud without waiting for tiering scans. SMB clients still write to the performance tier in a cloud write enabled volume. Cloud-write mode is disabled by default.

Having the ability to write directly to the cloud is helpful for cases like migrations, for example, where large amounts of data are transferred to a cluster than the cluster can support on the local tier. Without cloud write mode, during a migration, smaller amounts of data are transferred, then tiered, then transferred and tiered again, until the migration is complete. Using cloud write mode, this type of management is no longer required because the data is never transferred to the local tier.


.Before you begin

* You should be a cluster or SVM administrator.
* You must be at the advanced privilege level.
* The volume must be a read-write type volume.
* The volume must have the ALL tiering policy.


== Enable writing directly to the cloud during volume creation

.Steps

. Set the privilege level to advanced:
+
[source,cli]
----
set -privilege advanced
----
. Create a volume and enable cloud write mode:
+
[source,cli]
----
volume create -vserver <svm name> -volume <volume name> -is-cloud-write-enabled <true|false> -aggregate <local tier name>
----
+
The following example creates a volume named vol1 with cloud write enabled on the FabricPool local tier (aggr1):
+
----
volume create -vserver vs1 -volume vol1 -is-cloud-write-enabled true -aggregate aggr1
----

== Enable writing directly to the cloud on an existing volume

.Steps

. Set the privilege level to advanced:
+
[source,cli]
----
set -privilege advanced
----
. Modify a volume to enable cloud write mode:
+
[source,cli]
----
volume modify -vserver <svm name> -volume <volume name> -is-cloud-write-enabled true
----
+
The following example modifies the volume named vol1 to enable cloud write:
+
----
volume modify -vserver vs1 -volume vol1 -is-cloud-write-enabled true
----

== Disable writing directly to the cloud on a volume

.Steps

. Set the privilege level to advanced:
+
[source,cli]
----
set -privilege advanced
----
. Disable cloud write mode on a volume:
+
[source,cli]
----
volume modify -vserver <svm name> -volume <volume name> -is-cloud-write-enabled false
----
+
The following example disables cloud write mode on the volume named vol1:
+
----
volume modify -vserver vs1 -volume vol1 -is-cloud-write-enabled false
