Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can tier data to local object storage using ONTAP S3.

Tiering data to a local bucket provides a simple alternative to moving data to a different local tier. This procedure uses an existing bucket on the local cluster, or you can let ONTAP automatically create a new storage VM and a new bucket.

Keep in mind that once you attach to a local tier (aggregate) the cloud tier cannot be unattached.

An S3 license is required for this workflow, which creates a new S3 server and new bucket, or uses existing ones. This license included in link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/manage-licenses-concept.html#licenses-included-with-ontap-one[ONTAP One]. A FabricPool license is not required for this workflow.
