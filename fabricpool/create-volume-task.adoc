[.lead]

You can add volumes to FabricPool by creating new volumes directly in the FabricPool-enabled aggregate or by moving existing volumes from another aggregate to the FabricPool-enabled aggregate.

When you create a volume for FabricPool, you have the option to specify a tiering policy. If no tiering policy is specified, the created volume uses the default `snapshot-only` tiering policy. For a volume with the `snapshot-only` or `auto` tiering policy, you can also specify the tiering minimum cooling period.

.What you'll need

* Setting a volume to use the `auto` tiering policy or specifying the tiering minimum cooling period requires ONTAP 9.4 or later.
* Using FlexGroup volumes requires ONTAP 9.5 or later.
* Setting a volume to use the `all` tiering policy requires ONTAP 9.6 or later.
* Setting a volume to use the `-cloud-retrieval-policy` parameter requires ONTAP 9.8 or later.

.Steps

. Create a new volume for FabricPool by using the `volume create` command.
 ** The `-tiering-policy` optional parameter enables you to specify the tiering policy for the volume.
+
You can specify one of the following tiering policies:

  *** `snapshot-only` (default)
  *** `auto`
  *** `all`
  *** `backup` (deprecated)
  *** `none`
+
link:tiering-policies-concept.html#types-of-fabricpool-tiering-policies[Types of FabricPool tiering policies]

 ** The `-cloud-retrieval-policy` optional parameter enables cluster administrators with the advanced privilege level to override the default cloud migration or retrieval behavior controlled by the tiering policy.
+
You can specify one of the following cloud retrieval policies:

  *** `default`
+
The tiering policy determines what data is pulled back, so there is no change to cloud data retrieval with `default` cloud-retrieval-policy. This means the behavior is the same as in pre-ONTAP 9.8 releases:

   **** If the tiering policy is `none` or `snapshot-only`, then "`default`" means that any client-driven data read is pulled from the cloud tier to performance tier.
   **** If the tiering policy is `auto`, then any client-driven random read is pulled but not sequential reads.
   **** If the tiering policy is `all` then no client-driven data is pulled from the cloud tier.

  *** `on-read`
+
All client-driven data reads are pulled from the cloud tier to performance tier.

  *** `never`
+
No client-driven data is pulled from the cloud tier to performance tier

  *** `promote`
   **** For tiering policy `none`, all cloud data is pulled from the cloud tier to the performance tier
   **** For tiering policy `snapshot-only`, all active filesystem data is pulled from the cloud tier to the performance tier.

 ** The `-tiering-minimum-cooling-days` optional parameter in the advanced privilege level enables you to specify the tiering minimum cooling period for a volume that uses the `snapshot-only` or `auto` tiering policy.
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can specify a value between 2 and 183 for the tiering minimum cooling days. If you are using a version of ONTAP earlier than 9.8, you can specify a value between 2 and 63 for the tiering minimum cooling days.

.Example of creating a volume for FabricPool

The following example creates a volume called "`myvol1`" in the "`myFabricPool`" FabricPool-enabled aggregate. The tiering policy is set to `auto` and the tiering minimum cooling period is set to 45 days:

----
cluster1::*> volume create -vserver myVS -aggregate myFabricPool
-volume myvol1 -tiering-policy auto -tiering-minimum-cooling-days 45
----
