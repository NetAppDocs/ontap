Storing data in tiers can enhance the efficiency of your storage system. You can manage storage tiers by using FabricPool to store data in a tier, based on how frequently the data is accessed.

This procedure sets up an object store as the cloud tier for FabricPool. Keep in mind that once you attach to a local tier (aggr) the cloud tier cannot be unattached.

Starting August 21, 2021, a new Cloud Tiering BYOL licensing was introduced for tiering configurations that are supported within Cloud Manager using the Cloud Tiering service. link:cloud-install-fabricpool-task.html[Learn more about installing a FabricPool license].

If you are tiering to ONTAP S3, there are additional requirements:

* There must be an entry for the remote ONTAP S3 server’s hostname in the DNS server configured for the admin storage VM, including the S3 server's FQDN name and the IP addresses on its network interfaces.
* link:task_dp_prepare_mirror.html[Intercluster network interfaces] must be configured on both local and remote clusters, although cluster peering is not required.

You also have the option to create a volume tiering policy in System Manager.

.Steps

. Click *Storage > Tiers > Add Cloud Tier* and select the object store provider you want to use.

. If you want to create a cloud mirror, click *Add as FabricPool Mirror*.

A FabricPool mirror provides a method for you to seamlessly replace a data store, and it helps to ensure that your data is available in the event of disaster.
