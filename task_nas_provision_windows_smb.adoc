Create volumes to provide storage for Windows servers using the SMB protocol using System Manager, which is available with ONTAP 9.7 and later.

This procedure creates new volumes on an link:task_nas_enable_windows_smb.html[existing SMB-enabled storage VM] and creates a share for the volume root (/) directory. You can accept systems defaults when configuring volumes or specify custom configurations. After initial SMB configuration, you can also create additional shares and modify their properties.

You can create FlexVol volumes, or for large file systems with high performance requirements, you can create FlexGroup volumes.  See also link:task_nas_provision_flexgroup.html[Provision NAS storage for large file systems using FlexGroup volumes].

You can also save the specifications of this volume to an Ansible Playbook. For more details, go to link:task_admin_use_ansible_playbooks_add_edit_volumes_luns.html[Use Ansible Playbooks to add or edit volumes or LUNs].

If you want details about the range of ONTAP SMB protocol capabilities, consult the link:smb-admin/index.html[Reference overview].

.Before you begin

include::./_include/file-system-analytics-default-sm.adoc[]

.Steps

. Add a new volume in an SMB-enabled storage VM.

.. Click *Storage > Volumes* and then click *Add*.

.. Enter a name, select the storage VM, and enter a size.
+
Only storage VMs configured with the SMB protocol are listed. If only one storage VM configured with the SMB protocol is available, the *Storage VM* field is not shown.
+
*** If you select *Save* at this point, System Manager uses system defaults to create and add a FlexVol volume.

*** You can select *More options* to customize the configuration of the volume to enable services such as authorization, quality of service, and data protection.  Refer to <<Customize the volume configuration>>, then return here to complete the following steps.

. [[step2-compl-prov-win,Step 2 in the workflow]] Switch to a Windows client to verify that the share is accessible.

.. In Windows Explorer, map a drive to the share in the following format: `+\\_SMB_Server_Name__Share_Name_+`

.. On the newly created drive, create a test file, write text to it, and then delete the file.

After verifying access, you can restrict client access with the share ACL and set any desired security properties on the mapped drive. See link:smb-config/create-share-task.html[Create shares] for more information.

== Add or modify shares

You can add additional shares after initial SMB configuration. Shares are created with default values and properties you select. These can be modified later.

You can set the following share properties when configuring a share:

* Access permissions
* Share properties
** Enable continuous availability to shares that contain Hyper-V and SQL Server over SMB data (beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1). See also:
*** link:smb-hyper-v-sql/continuously-available-share-hyper-v-concept.html[Continuously available share requirements for Hyper-V over SMB]
*** link:smb-hyper-v-sql/continuously-available-share-sql-concept.html[Continuously available share requirements for SQL Server over SMB]
** Encrypt data with SMB 3.0 while accessing this share.

After initial configuration, you can also modify these properties:

* Symbolic links
** Enable or disable symlinks and widelinks
* Share properties
** Allow clients to access snapshots directory.
** Enable oplocks, allowing clients to lock files and cache content locally (default).
** Enable access-based enumeration (ABE) to display shared resources based on the access permissions of the user.

.Steps
. To add a new share in an SMB-enabled volume, click **Storage > Shares**, click **Add**, and select **Share**.

. To modify an existing share, click **Storage > Shares**, then click the image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon] and select **Edit**.

NOTE: After you save the volume, return to <<step2-compl-prov-win>> to complete provisioning for Windows servers using SMB.
