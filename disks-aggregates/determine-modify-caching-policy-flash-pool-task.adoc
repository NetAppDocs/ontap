You can assign cache-retention policies to volumes in Flash Pool local tiers to determine how long the volume data remains in the Flash Pool cache. However, in some cases changing the cache-retention policy might not impact the amount of time the volume's data remains in the cache.

.About this task

If your data meets any of the following conditions, changing your cache-retention policy might not have an impact:

* Your workload is sequential.
* Your workload does not reread the random blocks cached in the solid state drives (SSDs).
* The cache size of the volume is too small.

.Steps

The following steps check for the conditions that must be met by the data. The task must be done using the CLI in advanced privilege mode.

. Use the CLI to view the workload volume:
+
`statistics start -object workload_volume`
. Determine the workload pattern of the volume:
+
`statistics show -object workload_volume -instance _volume-workload_ -counter sequential_reads`
. Determine the hit rate of the volume:
+
`statistics show -object wafl_hya_vvol -instance _volume_ -counter read_ops_replaced_pwercent|wc_write_blks_overwritten_percent`
. Determine the `Cacheable Read` and `Project Cache Alloc` of the volume:
+
`system node run -node node_name wafl awa start _aggr_name_`
. Display the AWA summary:
+
`system node run -node node_name wafl awa print _aggr_name_`
. Compare the volume's hit rate to the `Cacheable Read`.
+
If the hit rate of the volume is greater than the `Cacheable Read`, then your workload does not reread random blocks cached in the SSDs.

. Compare the volume's current cache size to the `Project Cache Alloc`.
+
If the current cache size of the volume is greater than the `Project Cache Alloc`, then the size of your volume cache is too small.
