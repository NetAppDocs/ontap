You can use the `storage disk option modify` command to select a non-default policy for automatically assigning disk ownership or to disable automatic assignment of disk ownership.

Learn about link:disk-autoassignment-policy-concept.html[automatic assignment of disk ownership].

.About this task
If you have an HA pair with only DS460C shelves, the default auto-assignment policy is half-drawer. You cannot change to a non-default policy (bay, shelf, stack).

.Steps

. Modify automatic disk assignment:
.. If you want to select a non-default policy, enter: 
+
`storage disk option modify -autoassign-policy _autoassign_policy_ -node _node_name_`

 ** Use `stack` as the `_autoassign_policy_` to configure automatic ownership at the stack or loop level.
 ** Use `shelf` as the `_autoassign_policy_` to configure automatic ownership at the shelf level.
 ** Use `bay` as the `_autoassign_policy_` to configure automatic ownership at the bay level.

 .. If you want to disable automatic disk ownership assignment, enter:
+
`storage disk option modify -autoassign off -node _node_name_`

. Verify the automatic assignment settings for the disks:
+
`storage disk option show`
+
