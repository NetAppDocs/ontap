You can determine which FlexVol volumes are using the most space in a local tier (aggregate) and specifically which features within the volume.

The `volume show-footprint` command provides information about a volume's footprint, or its space usage within the containing aggregate.

The `volume show-footprint` command shows details about the space usage of each volume in an aggregate, including offline volumes. This command bridges the gap between the output of the `volume show-space` and `aggregate show-space` commands. All percentages are calculated as a percent of aggregate size.

The following example shows the `volume show-footprint` command output for a volume called testvol:

....
cluster1::> volume show-footprint testvol

      Vserver : thevs
      Volume  : testvol

      Feature                                   Used    Used%
      --------------------------------    ----------    -----
      Volume Data Footprint                  120.6MB       4%
      Volume Guarantee                        1.88GB      71%
      Flexible Volume Metadata               11.38MB       0%
      Delayed Frees                           1.36MB       0%
      Total Footprint                         2.01GB      76%
....

The following table explains some of the key rows of the output of the `volume show-footprint` command and what you can do to try to decrease space usage by that feature:

|===

h| Row/feature name h| Description/contents of row h| Some ways to decrease

a|
`Volume Data Footprint`
a|
The total amount of space used in the containing aggregate by a volume's data in the active file system and the space used by the volume's Snapshot copies. This row does not include reserved space.
a|

* Deleting data from the volume.
* Deleting Snapshot copies from the volume.

a|
`Volume Guarantee`
a|
The amount of space reserved by the volume in the aggregate for future writes. The amount of space reserved depends on the guarantee type of the volume.
a|
Changing the type of guarantee for the volume to `none`.
a|
`Flexible Volume Metadata`
a|
The total amount of space used in the aggregate by the volume's metadata files.
a|
No direct method to control.
a|
`Delayed Frees`
a|
Blocks that ONTAP used for performance and cannot be immediately freed. For SnapMirror destinations, this row has a value of `0` and is not displayed.

a|
No direct method to control.
a|
`File Operation Metadata`
a|
The total amount of space reserved for file operation metadata.
a|
No direct method to control.
a|
`Total Footprint`
a|
The total amount of space that the volume uses in the aggregate. It is the sum of all of the rows.
a|
Any of the methods used to decrease space used by a volume.
