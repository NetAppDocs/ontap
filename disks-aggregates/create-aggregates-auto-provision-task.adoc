[.lead]
If the best-practice recommendation that ONTAP provides for automatically adding a local tier (creating an aggregate with auto-provisioning)
is appropriate in your environment, you can accept the recommendation and let ONTAP add the local tier.

.Before you begin

Disks must be owned by a node before they can be used in a local tier (aggregate).  If your cluster is not configured to use automatic disk ownership assignment, you must link:manual-assign-disks-ownership-prep-task.html[assign ownership manually].

Learn more about the commands described in this procedure in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/[ONTAP command reference^].

.Steps

.	In System Manager, click *Storage > Tiers*.

.	From the *Tiers* page, click image:icon-add-local-tier.png[Add local tier icon]  to create a new local tier:
+
The *Add Local Tier* page shows the recommended number of local tiers that can be created on the nodes and the usable storage available.

.	Click *Recommended details* to view the configuration recommended by System Manager.
+
System Manager displays the following information beginning with ONTAP 9.8:
+

*	*Local tier name* (you can edit the local tier name beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1)
*	*Node name*
*	*Usable size*
*	*Type of storage*

+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, additional information is displayed:

* *Disks*: showing the number, size, and type of the disks
*	*Layout*: showing the RAID group layout, including which disks are parity or data and which slots are unused.
*	*Spare disks*:  showing the node name, the number and size of spare disks, and the type of storage.

.	Perform one of the following steps:

h| If you want to…	h| Then do this…

a| Accept the recommendations from System Manager.
a| Proceed to <<step5-okm-encrypt,the step for configuring the Onboard Key Manager for encryption>>.

a| Manually configure the local tiers and *_not_* use the recommendations from System Manager.
a| Proceed to link:create-aggregates-manual-task.html[Add a local tier (create aggregate) manually]:

* For ONTAP 9.10.1 and earlier, follow the steps to use the CLI.
* Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, follow the steps to use System Manager.

..	Enter a passphrase.
..	Enter the passphrase again to confirm it.
..	Save the passphrase for future use in case the system needs to be recovered.
..	Back up the key database for future use.

.	Click *Save* to create the local tier and add it to your storage solution.

.CLI

You run the `storage aggregate auto-provision` command to generate aggregate layout recommendations. You can then create aggregates after reviewing and approving ONTAP recommendations.

.What you'll need

ONTAP 9.2 or later must be running on your cluster.

.About this task

The default summary generated with the `storage aggregate auto-provision` command lists the recommended aggregates to be created, including names and usable size. You can view the list and determine whether you want to create the recommended aggregates when prompted.

You can also display a detailed summary by using the `-verbose` option, which displays the following reports:

* Per node summary of new aggregates to create, discovered spares, and remaining spare disks and partitions after aggregate creation
* New data aggregates to create with counts of disks and partitions to be used
* RAID group layout showing how spare disks and partitions will be used in new data aggregates to be created
* Details about spare disks and partitions remaining after aggregate creation

If you are familiar with the auto-provision method and your environment is correctly prepared, you can use the `-skip-confirmation` option to create the recommended aggregate without display and confirmation. The `storage aggregate auto-provision` command is not affected by the CLI session `-confirmations` setting.

Learn more about the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/storage-aggregate-auto-provision.html[`storage aggregate auto-provision`^] command in the ONTAP command reference.

.Steps

. Run the `storage aggregate auto-provision` command with the desired display options.
 ** no options: Display standard summary
 ** `-verbose` option: Display detailed summary
 ** `-skip-confirmation` option: Create recommended aggregates without display or confirmation


.	Perform one of the following steps:
