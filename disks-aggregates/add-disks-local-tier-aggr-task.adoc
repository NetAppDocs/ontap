*Use System Manager to add capacity (ONTAP 9.8 and later)*

You can add capacity to a local tier by adding capacity disks.

NOTE: Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, you can use System Manager to view the committed capacity of a local tier to determine if additional capacity is required for the local tier.  See  link:../concept_capacity_measurements_in_sm.html[Monitor capacity in System Manager].

.About this task

You perform this task only if you have installed ONTAP 9.8 or later.  If you installed an earlier version of ONTAP, refer to the tab (or section) labeled "System Manager (ONTAP 9.7 and earlier)
".

.Steps

. Click *Storage > Tiers*.

. Click image:icon_kabob.gif[kebab icon] next to the name of the local tier to which you want to add capacity.

. Click *Add Capacity*.
+
NOTE: If there are no spare disks that you can add, then the *Add Capacity* option is not shown, and you cannot increase the capacity of the local tier.

. Perform the following steps, based on the version of ONTAP that is installed:
+
[cols="30,70"]
|===

h| If this version of ONTAP is installed...  h| Perform these steps...

a| ONTAP 9.8, 9.9, or 9.10.1
a|
. If the node contains multiple storage tiers, then select the number of disks you want to add to the local tier.  Otherwise, if the node contains only a single storage tier, the added capacity is estimated automatically.
. Click *Add*.

a| Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1
a|
. Select the disk type and number of disks.
. If you want to add disks to a new RAID group, check the check box.  The RAID allocation is displayed.
. Click *Save*.

|===

. (Optional) The process takes some time to complete. If you want to run the process in the background, select *Run in Background*.

. After the process completes, you can view the increased capacity amount in the local tier information at *Storage > Tiers*.

[[increase-cap-97-earlier]]
*Use System Manager to add capacity (ONTAP 9.7 and earlier)*

You can add capacity to a local tier (aggregate) by adding capacity disks.

.About this task

You perform this task only if you have installed ONTAP 9.7 or earlier. If you installed ONTAP 9.8 or later, refer to <<increase-cap-98-later,Use System Manager to add capacity (ONTAP 9.8 or later)>>.

.Steps

.	(For ONTAP 9.7 only) Click *(Return to classic version)*.

.	Click *Hardware and Diagnostics > Aggregates*.

.	Select the aggregate to which you want to add capacity disks, and then click *Actions > Add Capacity*.
+
NOTE: You should add disks that are of the same size as the other disks in the aggregate.

.	(For ONTAP 9.7 only) Click *Switch to the new experience*.

.	Click *Storage > Tiers* to verify the size of the new aggregate.

*Use the CLI to add capacity*

The procedure for adding partitioned disks to an aggregate is similar to the procedure for adding unpartitioned disks.

.What you'll need

You must know what the RAID group size is for the aggregate you are adding the storage to.

.About this task

When you expand an aggregate, you should be aware of whether you are adding partition or unpartitioned disks to the aggregate. When you add unpartitioned drives to an existing aggregate, the size of the existing RAID groups is inherited by the new RAID group, which can affect the number of parity disks required. If an unpartitioned disk is added to a RAID group composed of partitioned disks, the new disk is partitioned, leaving an unused spare partition.

When you provision partitions, you must ensure that you do not leave the node without a drive with both partitions as spare. If you do, and the node experiences a controller disruption, valuable information about the problem (the core file) might not be available to provide to the technical support.

NOTE: Do not use the `disklist` command to expand your aggregates. This could cause partition misalignment.

.Steps

. Show the available spare storage on the system that owns the aggregate:
+
`storage aggregate show-spare-disks -original-owner _node_name_`
+
You can use the `-is-disk-shared` parameter to show only partitioned drives or only unpartitioned drives.

. Add the storage to the aggregate:
+
`storage aggregate add-disks -aggregate _aggr_name_ -raidgroup new -diskcount _number_of_disks_or_partitions_`
+
When creating a Flash Pool aggregate, if you are adding disks with a different checksum than the aggregate, or if you are adding disks to a mixed checksum aggregate, you must use the `-checksumstyle` parameter.
+
If you are adding disks to a Flash Pool aggregate, you must use the `-disktype` parameter to specify the disk type.
+
You can use the `-disksize` parameter to specify a size of the disks to add. Only disks with approximately the specified size are selected for addition to the aggregate.
