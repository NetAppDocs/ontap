You can delete a local tier if there are no volumes on the local tier.

include::../_include/local-tier-aggregate-note.adoc[]

The `storage aggregate delete` command deletes a storage local tier. The command fails if there are volumes present on the local tier. If the local tier has an object store attached to it, then in addition to deleting the local, the command deletes the objects in the object store as well. No changes are made to the object store configuration as part of this command.

The following example deletes an local tier named "`aggr1`":

....
> storage aggregate delete -aggregate aggr1
....
