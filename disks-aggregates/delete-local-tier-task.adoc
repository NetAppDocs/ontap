You can delete a local tier (aggregate) if there are no volumes on the local tier.

The procedure you follow depends on the interface you use--System Manager or the CLI:

The `storage aggregate delete` command deletes a storage aggregate. The command fails if there are volumes present on the aggregate. If the aggregate has an object store attached to it, then in addition to deleting the aggregate, the command deletes the objects in the object store as well. No changes are made to the object store configuration as part of this command.

The following example deletes an aggregate named "`aggr1`":

....
> storage aggregate delete -aggregate aggr1
....
