[.lead]
When an HA pair is configured to use root-data partitioning by the factory, ownership of the data partitions is split between both nodes in the pair for use in an active-active configuration. If you want to use the HA pair in an active-passive configuration, you must update partition ownership before creating your data local tier (aggregate).

.Before you begin

* You should have decided which node will be the active node and which node will be the passive node.
* Storage failover must be configured on the HA pair.

.About this task

This task is performed on two nodes: Node A and Node B.

This procedure is designed for nodes for which no data local tier (aggregate) has been created from the partitioned disks.

Learn about link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Storage_Software/ONTAP_OS/What_are_the_rules_for_Advanced_Disk_Partitioning%3F[advanced disk partitioning^]. 

.Steps

All commands are inputted at the cluster shell.

. View the current ownership of the data partitions:
+
`storage aggregate show-spare-disks`
+
The output shows that half of the data partitions are owned by one node and half are owned by the other node. All of the data partitions should be spare.

. Enter the advanced privilege level:
+
`set advanced`
. For each data partition owned by the node that will be the passive node, assign it to the active node:
+
`storage disk assign -force -data true -owner _active_node_name_ -disk _disk_name_`
+
You do not need to include the partition as part of the disk name.
+
You would enter a command similar to the following example for each data partition you need to reassign:
+
`storage disk assign -force -data true -owner cluster1-01 -disk 1.0.3`

. Confirm that all of the partitions are assigned to the active node.

Note that cluster1-02 still owns a spare root partition.

. Return to administrative privilege:
+
`set admin`
. Create your data aggregate, leaving at least one data partition as spare:
+
`storage aggregate create _new_aggr_name_ -diskcount _number_of_partitions_ -node _active_node_name_`
+
The data aggregate is created and is owned by the active node.
