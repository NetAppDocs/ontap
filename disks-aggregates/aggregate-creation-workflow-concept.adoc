[.lead]
Creating local tiers (aggregates) provides storage to volumes on your system.

The workflow for creating local tiers (aggregates) is specific to the interface you use: System Manager or the CLI.

.System Manager
--
System Manager creates local tiers based on recommended best practices for configuring local tiers.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, you can decide to configure local tiers manually if you want a different configuration than the one recommended during the automatic process to add a local tier.

.CLI
--
Beginning with ONTAP 9.2, ONTAP can provide recommended configurations when you create aggregates (auto-provisioning).  If the recommended configurations, based on best practices, are appropriate in your environment, you can accept them to create the aggregates. Otherwise, you can create aggregates manually.
