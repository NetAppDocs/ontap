You should modify the caching policy of a volume only if a different caching policy is expected to provide better performance. You can modify the caching policy of a volume on a Flash Pool local tier (aggregate).

.Before you begin

You must determine whether you want to modify your caching policy.

.About this task

In most cases, the default caching policy of "`auto`" is the best caching policy that you can use. The caching policy should be changed only if a different policy provides better performance for your workload. Configuring the wrong caching policy can severely degrade volume performance; the performance degradation could increase gradually over time. You should use caution when modifying caching policies. If you experience performance issues with a volume for which the caching policy has been changed, you should return the caching policy to "`auto`".


.Step

. Use the CLI to modify the volume's caching policy:
+
`volume modify -volume _volume_name_ -caching-policy _policy_name_`

.Example

The following example modifies the caching policy of a volume named "`vol2`" to the policy "`none`":

`volume modify -volume vol2 -caching-policy none`
