Beginning with ONTAP 9.2, a new root-data partitioning option is available from the Boot Menu that provides additional management features for disks that are configured for root-data partitioning.

The following management features are available under the Boot Menu Option 9.

* *Unpartition all disks and remove their ownership information*
+
This option is useful if your system is configured for root-data partitioning and you need to reinitialize it with a different configuration.

* *Clean configuration and initialize node with partitioned disks*
+
This option is useful for the following:

 ** Your system is not configured for root-data partitioning and you would like to configure it for root-data partitioning
 ** Your system is incorrectly configured for root-data partitioning and you need to correct it
 ** You have an AFF platform or a FAS platform with only SSDs attached that is configured for the previous version of root-data partitioning and you want to upgrade it to the newer version of root-data partitioning to gain increased storage efficiency

* *Clean configuration and initialize node with whole disks*
+
This option is useful if you need to:

 ** Unpartition existing partitions
 ** Remove local disk ownership
 ** Reinitialize your system with whole disks using RAID-DP
