[.lead]
You can configure a Flash Pool (local tier) aggregate by adding one or more allocation units from an SSD storage pool to an existing HDD local tier.

You manage Flash Pool local tiers differently when they use SSD storage pools to provide their cache than when they use discrete SSDs.

////
The procedure that you follow depends on the interface that you use--System Manager or the CLI:

[role="tabbed-block"]
====
.System Manager

*Use System Manager to determine whether a Flash Pool local tier is using an SSD storage pool*

*Use the CLI to determine whether a Flash Pool local tier is using an SSD storage pool*
////

.Step

. Display the aggregate's drives by RAID group:
+
`storage aggregate show-status _aggr_name_`
+
If the aggregate is using one or more SSD storage pools, the value for the `Position` column for the SSD RAID groups is displayed as `Shared`, and the name of the storage pool is displayed next to the RAID group name.
