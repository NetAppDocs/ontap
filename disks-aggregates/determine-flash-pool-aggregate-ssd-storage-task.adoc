[.lead]
You can configure a Flash Pool local tier by adding one or more allocation units from an SSD storage pool to an existing HDD local tier.

include::../_include/local-tier-aggregate-note.adoc[]

You manage Flash Pool local tiers differently when they use SSD storage pools to provide their cache than when they use discrete SSDs.

.Step

. Display the local tier's drives by RAID group:
+
`storage aggregate show-status _aggr_name_`
+
If the local tier is using one or more SSD storage pools, the value for the `Position` column for the SSD RAID groups is displayed as `Shared`, and the name of the storage pool is displayed next to the RAID group name.
