[.lead]
If you want the added protection of triple-parity, you can convert from RAID-DP to RAID-TEC. RAID-TEC is recommended if the size of the disks used in your aggregate is greater than 4 TiB.

.What you'll need

The aggregate that is to be converted must have a minimum of six disks.

.About this task

Hard disk drive (HDD) aggregates can be converted from RAID-DP to RAID-TEC. This includes HDD tiers in Flash Pool aggregates.

.Steps

. Verify that the aggregate is online and has a minimum of six disks:
+
`storage aggregate show-status -aggregate _aggregate_name_`
. Convert the aggregate from RAID-DP to RAID-TEC:
+
`storage aggregate modify -aggregate _aggregate_name_ -raidtype raid_tec`
. Verify that the aggregate RAID policy is RAID-TEC:
+
`storage aggregate show _aggregate_name_`
