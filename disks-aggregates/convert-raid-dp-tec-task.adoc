[.lead]
If you want the added protection of triple-parity, you can convert from RAID-DP to RAID-TEC. RAID-TEC is recommended if the size of the disks used in your local tier (aggregate) is greater than 4 TiB.

.What you'll need

The local tier (aggregate) that is to be converted must have a minimum of seven disks.

.About this task

* Hard disk drive (HDD) local tiers can be converted from RAID-DP to RAID-TEC. This includes HDD tiers in Flash Pool local tiers.
* To understand the implications of converting between RAID types, refer to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/storage-aggregate-modify.html#parameters[parameters^] for the `storage aggregate modify` command.

[-T, -disktype {ATA | BSAS | FCAL | FSAS | LUN | MSATA | SAS | SSD | VMDISK | SSD-NVM | SSD-CAP | SSD-ZNS | VMLUN | VMLUN-SSD}] - Disk Type
This parameter specifies the disk type of the RAID groups to be modified. In case of Flash Pool, it specifies either the HDD tier or the SSD tier. If the HDD tier is composed of more than one type of disk, specifying any of the disk types in use causes that tier to be modified. If the current aggregate RAID type is mixed_raid_type, this parameter is mandatory.

.Steps

. Verify that the aggregate is online and has a minimum of six disks:
+
`storage aggregate show-status -aggregate _aggregate_name_`
. Convert the aggregate from RAID-DP to RAID-TEC:
+
`storage aggregate modify -aggregate _aggregate_name_ -raidtype raid_tec`
. Verify that the aggregate RAID policy is RAID-TEC:
+
`storage aggregate show _aggregate_name_`
