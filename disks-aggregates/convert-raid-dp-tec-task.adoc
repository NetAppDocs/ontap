include::../_include/local-tier-aggregate-note.adoc[]

.Before you begin

The local tier that is to be converted must have a minimum of seven disks.

.About this task

* Hard disk drive (HDD) local tiers can be converted from RAID-DP to RAID-TEC. This includes HDD tiers in Flash Pool local tiers.
* Learn more about `storage aggregate modify` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/storage-aggregate-modify.html#parameter[ONTAP command reference^]

.Steps

. Verify that the local tier is online and has a minimum of six disks:
+
`storage aggregate show-status -aggregate _aggregate_name_`
. Convert the local tier from RAID-DP to RAID-TEC:
+
`storage aggregate modify -aggregate _aggregate_name_ -raidtype raid_tec`
. Verify that the local tier RAID policy is RAID-TEC:
+
`storage aggregate show _aggregate_name_`
