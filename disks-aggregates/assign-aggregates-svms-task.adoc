If you assign one or more local tiers to a storage virtual machine (storage VM or SVM, formerly known as Vserver), then you can use only those local tiers to contain volumes for that storage VM (SVM).

.Before you begin

The storage VM and the local tiers you want to assign to that storage VM must already exist.

.About this task

Assigning local tiers to your storage VMs helps you keep your storage VMs isolated from each other; this is especially important in a multi-tenancy environment.

.Steps

. Check the list of local tiers already assigned to the SVM:
+
`vserver show -fields aggr-list`
+
The local tiers currently assigned to the SVM are displayed. If there are no local tiers assigned, `-` is displayed.

. Add or remove assigned local tiers, depending on your requirements:
+

|===

h| If you want to... h| Use this command...

a|
Assign additional local tiers
a|
`vserver add-aggregates`
a|
Unassign local tiers
a|
`vserver remove-aggregates`
|===
The listed local tiers are assigned to or removed from the SVM. If the SVM already has volumes that use an aggregate that is not assigned to the SVM, a warning message is displayed, but the command is completed successfully. Any local tiers that were already assigned to the SVM and that were not named in the command are unaffected.

.Example

In the following example, the local tiers aggr1 and aggr2 are assigned to SVM svm1:

`vserver add-aggregates -vserver svm1 -aggregates aggr1,aggr2`
