You can set the ownership of the container disk or the partitions manually or by using auto-assignment--just as you do for unpartitioned disks.

[NOTE]
====
If a container disk fails in a half-populated shelf and is replaced, ONTAP will not auto-assign ownership. In this case, any assignment of new disks will need to be done manually. To make auto-assign work on half-populated shelves, place disks equally on lower half and 6 on far right bays to begin with. That is, 6 disks from bays 0-5 and 6 disks from bays 18-23. After the container disk is assigned in an ADP-configured system, ONTAP's software will handle any partitioning and partition assignments that are required, without user intervention.
