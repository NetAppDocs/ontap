_Local tiers_, also called _aggregates_, are logical containers for the disks managed by a node. You can use local tiers to isolate workloads with different performance demands, to tier data with different access patterns, or to segregate data for regulatory purposes.

[NOTE]
Prior to ONTAP 9.7, System Manager uses the term _aggregate_ to describe a _local tier_. Regardless of your ONTAP version, the ONTAP CLI uses the term _aggregate_.

* For business-critical applications that need the lowest possible latency and the highest possible performance, you might create a local tier consisting entirely of SSDs.
* To tier data with different access patterns, you can create a _hybrid local tier_, deploying flash as high-performance cache for a working data set, while using lower-cost HDDs or object storage for less frequently accessed data.
** A link:flash-pool-aggregate-caching-policies-concept.html[_Flash Pool_] consists of both SSDs and HDDs.
** A link:../concepts/fabricpool-concept.html[_FabricPool_] consists of an all-SSD local tier with an attached object store.
* If you need to segregate archived data from active data for regulatory purposes, you can use a local tier consisting of capacity HDDs, or a combination of performance and capacity HDDs.

== Working with local tiers in a MetroCluster configuration

If you have a MetroCluster configuration, you should following the procedures in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/install-ip/concept_considerations_when_using_ontap_in_a_mcc_configuration.html[MetroCluster^] documentation for initial configuration and guidelines for local tiers and disk management.
