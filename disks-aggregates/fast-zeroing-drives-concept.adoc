[.lead]
On systems freshly installed with ONTAP 9.4 or later and systems reinitialized with ONTAP 9.4 or later, _fast zeroing_ is used to zero drives.  

With _fast zeroing_, drives are zeroed in seconds.  This is done automatically before provisioning and greatly reduces the time it takes to initialize the system, create local tiers, or expand local tiers when spare drives are added.

_Fast zeroing_ is supported on both SSDs and HDDs.  

NOTE: _Fast zeroing_ is not supported on systems upgraded from ONTAP 9.3 or earlier.  ONTAP 9.4 or later must be freshly installed or the system must be reinitialized. In ONTAP 9.3 and earlier, drives are also automatically zeroed by ONTAP; however, the process takes longer.

If you need to manually zero a drive, you can use one of the following methods.  In ONTAP 9.4 and later, manually zeroing a drive also takes only seconds.
