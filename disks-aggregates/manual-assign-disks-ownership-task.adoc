Disks must be owned by a node before they can be used in an aggregate. If your cluster is not configured to use automatic disk ownership assignment, you must assign ownership manually. You cannot reassign ownership of a disk that is in use in an aggregate.

.Steps

. Display all unowned disks:
+
`storage disk show -container-type unassigned`
. Assign each disk:
+
`storage disk assign -disk _disk_name_ -owner _owner_name_`
+
You can use the wildcard character to assign more than one disk at once. If you are reassigning a spare disk that is already owned by a different node, you must use the `-force` option
