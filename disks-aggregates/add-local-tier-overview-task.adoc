[.lead]
To add a local tier (create an aggregate), you follow a specific workflow.  

You determine the number of disks or disk partitions that you need for the local tier and decide which method to use to create the local tier.   You can add local tiers automatically by letting ONTAP assign the configuration, or you can manually specify the configuration.
