Before converting an existing local tier (aggregate) to a Flash Pool local tier, you can determine whether the local tier is I/O bound and the best Flash Pool cache size for your workload and budget. You can also check whether the cache of an existing Flash Pool local tier is sized correctly.

.What you'll need

You should know approximately when the local tier you are analyzing experiences its peak load.

.Steps

. Enter advanced mode:
+
`set advanced`
. If you need to determine whether an existing local tier (aggregate) would be a good candidate for conversion to a Flash Pool aggregate, determine how busy the disks in the aggregate are during a period of peak load, and how that is affecting latency:
+
`statistics show-periodic -object disk:raid_group -instance _raid_group_name_ -counter disk_busy|user_read_latency -interval 1 -iterations 60`
+
You can decide whether reducing latency by adding Flash Pool cache makes sense for this aggregate.
+
The following command shows the statistics for the first RAID group of the aggregate "`aggr1`":
+
`statistics show-periodic -object disk:raid_group -instance /aggr1/plex0/rg0 -counter disk_busy|user_read_latency -interval 1 -iterations 60`

. Start Automated Workload Analyzer (AWA):
+
`storage automated-working-set-analyzer start -node _node_name_ -aggregate _aggr_name_`
+
AWA begins collecting workload data for the volumes associated with the specified aggregate.

. Exit advanced mode:
+
`set admin`
+
Allow AWA to run until one or more intervals of peak load have occurred. AWA collects workload statistics for the volumes associated with the specified aggregate, and analyzes data for up to one rolling week in duration. Running AWA for more than one week will report only on data collected from the most recent week. Cache size estimates are based on the highest loads seen during the data collection period; the load does not need to be high for the entire data collection period.

. Enter advanced mode:
+
`set advanced`
. Display the workload analysis:
+
`storage automated-working-set-analyzer show -node _node_name_ -instance`
. Stop AWA:
+
`storage automated-working-set-analyzer stop _node_name_`
+
All workload data is flushed and is no longer available for analysis.

. Exit advanced mode:
+
`set admin`
