[.lead]
When you add solid state drives (SSDs) to an SSD storage pool, you increase the storage pool's physical and usable sizes and allocation unit size. The larger allocation unit size also affects allocation units that have already been allocated to local tiers.

.Before you begin

You must have determined that this operation will not cause you to exceed the cache limit for your HA pair. ONTAP does not prevent you from exceeding the cache limit when you add SSDs to an SSD storage pool, and doing so can render the newly added storage capacity unavailable for use.

.About this task

When you add SSDs to an existing SSD storage pool, the SSDs must be owned by one node or the other of the same HA pair that already owned the existing SSDs in the storage pool. You can add SSDs that are owned by either node of the HA pair.

The SSD you add to the storage pool must be the same size as disk currently used in the storage pool.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, you can use System Manager to add SSDs to an SSD storage pool.

.Steps

. Click *Storage > Tiers* and locate the *Storage Pools* section.
. Locate the storage pool, click image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon], and select *Add Disks*.
. Choose the disk type and select the number of disks.
. Review the estimate cache size.

.Steps

. *Optional:* View the current allocation unit size and available storage for the storage pool:
+
`storage pool show -instance _sp_name_`
. Find available SSDs:
+
`storage disk show -container-type spare -type SSD`
. Add the SSDs to the storage pool:
+
`storage pool add -storage-pool sp_name -disk-list _disk1,disk2…_`
+
The system displays which Flash Pool local tiers will have their size increased by this operation and by how much, and prompts you to confirm the operation.
