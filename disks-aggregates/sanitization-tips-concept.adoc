If you are creating or backing up local tiers (aggregates) to contain data that might need to be sanitized, following some simple guidelines will reduce the time it takes to sanitize your data.

* Make sure your local tiers containing sensitive data are not larger than they need to be.
+
If they are larger than needed, sanitization requires more time, disk space, and bandwidth.

* When you back up local tiers containing sensitive data, avoid backing them up to local tier that also contain large amounts of nonsensitive data.
+
This reduces the resources required to move nonsensitive data before sanitizing sensitive data.
