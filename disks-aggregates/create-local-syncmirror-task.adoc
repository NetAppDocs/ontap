You can enable SyncMirror when you manually create a local tier to synchronously mirror local tier data.

.Before you begin

* The cluster must be initialized with only internal storage.
* Cluster setup must have been completed on both nodes.

.About this task
This procedure creates mirrored data local tiers of equal size on each cluster node, and each local tier has a disk count of 44.

.Steps
. Disable storage auto-assignment:
+
`storage disk option modify -node * -autoassign off`

. Confirm that auto-assignment is disabled:
+
`storage disk option show`

. Attach the external shelf.

. Assign the external drives to each node specifying pool 1:
+
`storage disk assign -disk <disk ID> -owner <node name> -pool 1`

. Mirror the root local tier on each node:
+
`storage aggregate mirror -aggregate <node1 root-aggr>`
+
`storage aggregate mirror -aggregate <node2 root-aggr>`
+
NOTE: Drives in pool 1 are automatically partitioned to match those in plex 0.

. On node 1, create a mirrored data local tier using a disk count of 44.  This selects 22 partitions from pool 0 and 22 partitions from pool 1.
+
`storage aggregate create -node <node1 name> -aggregate <node1 aggr-name> -diskcount 44 -mirror true`

. On node 2, create a mirrored data local tier using a disk count of 44. This selects 22 partitions from pool 0 and 22 partitions from pool 1.
+
`storage aggregate create -node <node2 name> -aggregate <node2 aggr-name> -diskcount 44 -mirror true`

. Verify that local tiers of equal size were successfully created:
+
`storage aggregate show`
