If a local tier (aggregate) runs out of free space, various problems can result that range from loss of data to disabling a volume's guarantee. There are multiple ways to make more space in a local tier.

All of the methods have various consequences. Prior to taking any action, you should read the relevant section in the documentation.

The following are some common ways to make space in local tier, in order of least to most consequences:

* Add disks to the local tier.

* Move some volumes to another local tier with available space.

* Shrink the size of volume-guaranteed volumes in the local tier.

* Delete unneeded volume Snapshot copies if the volume's guarantee type is "`none`".

* Delete unneeded volumes.

* Enable space-saving features, such as deduplication or compression.

* (Temporarily) disable features that are using a large amount of metadata .
