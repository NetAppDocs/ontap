You can view disk ownership to determine which node controls the storage. You can also view the partition ownership on systems that use shared disks.

.Steps

. Display the ownership of physical disks:
+
`storage disk show -ownership`
+
....
cluster::> storage disk show -ownership
Disk     Aggregate Home     Owner    DR Home  Home ID     Owner ID   DR Home ID  Reserver    Pool
-------- --------- -------- -------- -------- ---------- ----------- ----------- ----------- ------
1.0.0    aggr0_2   node2    node2    -        2014941509 2014941509  -           2014941509  Pool0
1.0.1    aggr0_2   node2    node2    -        2014941509 2014941509  -           2014941509  Pool0
1.0.2    aggr0_1   node1    node1    -        2014941219 2014941219  -           2014941219  Pool0
1.0.3    -         node1    node1    -        2014941219 2014941219  -           2014941219  Pool0

....

. If you have a system that uses shared disks, you can display the partition ownership:
+
`storage disk show -partition-ownership`
+
....
cluster::> storage disk show -partition-ownership
