You can assign cache-retention policies to volumes in Flash Pool local tiers (aggregates). Data in volumes with a high cache-retention policy remains in cache longer and data in volumes with a low cache-retention policy is removed sooner. This increases performance of your critical workloads by making high priority information accessible at a faster rate for a longer period of time.

.Steps

Use the CLI in advanced privilege mode to perform the following steps:

. Change the privilege setting to advanced:
+
`set -privilege advanced`
. Verify the volume's cache-retention policy:
+
By default the cache retention policy is "`normal`".

. Set the cache-retention policy:
