[.lead]
If you reduce the size of your local tier (aggregate) and no longer need triple parity, you can convert your RAID policy from RAID-TEC to RAID-DP and reduce the number of disks you need for RAID parity.

.What you'll need

The maximum RAID group size for RAID-TEC is larger than the maximum RAID group size for RAID-DP. If the largest RAID-TEC group size is not within the RAID-DP limits, you cannot convert to RAID-DP.

.Steps

. Verify that the aggregate is online and has a minimum of six disks:
+
`storage aggregate show-status -aggregate _aggregate_name_`
. Convert the aggregate from RAID-TEC to RAID-DP:
+
`storage aggregate modify -aggregate _aggregate_name_ -raidtype raid_dp`
. Verify that the aggregate RAID policy is RAID-DP:
+
`storage aggregate show _aggregate_name_`
