The System Manager dashboard offers a quick and comprehensive view of your ONTAP cluster from a single location.

Using the System Manager dashboard, you can view at-a-glance information about important alerts and notifications, the efficiency and capacity of storage tiers and volumes, the nodes that are available in a cluster, the status of the nodes in a high-availability (HA) pair, the most active applications and objects, and the performance metrics of a cluster or a node.

The dashboard includes four panels described as follows:

== Health

The Health view displays information on the overall health of all discoverable nodes in your cluster.

The Health view also displays the errors and warnings at a cluster level, such as unconfigured node details, indicating the characteristics that can be modified to enhance cluster performance.

Click image:icon_arrow.gif[Arrow icon] to expand the Health view to obtain an overview of the cluster such as the name of the cluster, the version, the date and time of creation of the cluster, and more. You can also monitor the statistics related to the health of the nodes associated with a cluster. You can manage tags that let you group and identify resources in your environment. The Insights section helps you optimize the capacity, security compliance, and configuration of your system.

== Capacity

The Capacity view displays the storage space of a cluster. You can view the total logical space used, total physical space used, and the available disk space. 

You can choose to register with ActiveIQ to view historical cluster data.
Click image:icon_arrow.gif[Arrow icon] to expand the Capacity view to see an overview of the tiers associated with a cluster. You can view capacity information about each of the tiers: the total space, used space, and available space. Details are displayed for throughput, IOPS, and latency. link:./concepts/capacity-measurements-in-sm-concept.html[Learn more about these capacity measurements in System Manager]. 

You can choose to add a local tier or a cloud tier using the Capacity view. For more information, refer to link:task_admin_monitor_capacity_in_sm.html[View the capacity of a cluster].

== Network

The Network view displays the physical ports, network interfaces, and storage VMs that are part of the network. 

The Network view displays the type of clients connected to the network. Each of these network-connected clients are represented by a number (for example “NVMe/FC 16”). Select the number to view specific details on each of these network elements.

== Performance

The Performance view displays performance statistics to help to monitor the health and efficiency of your ONTAP cluster. The statistics include key cluster performance indicators such as latency, throughput, and IOPS, represented as graphs. 

The Performance view displays performance statistics at different time intervals by day, hour, week, or year. You can quickly analyze cluster performance by using the various graphs and identify the characteristics that might require optimization. This quick analysis helps you decide how you might add or move workloads. You can also look at peak usage times to plan for potential changes.

The performance view displays the total performance metrics related to latency, throughput, and IOPS.

Beginning with 9.15.1, the performance view is enhanced to display graphs for read, write, other, and total performance metrics related to latency, throughput, and IOPS. Other metrics include any operations that aren't read or write.

The performance values refresh every 3 seconds and the performance graph refreshes every 15 seconds. A graph will not display if information about cluster performance is not available.
