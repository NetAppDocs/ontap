You can create a task without assigning a schedule and use the `vserver vscan on-demand-task schedule` command to assign a schedule; or add a schedule while creating the task.

.About this task

The schedule assigned with the `vserver vscan on-demand-task schedule` command overrides a schedule already assigned with the `vserver vscan on-demand-task create` command.

.Before you begin

.Steps

. Schedule an on-demand task:
+
`vserver vscan on-demand-task schedule -vserver _data_SVM_ -task-name _task_name_ -schedule cron_schedule`
+
The following command schedules an on-access task named `Task2` on the `vs2` SVM:
+
----
cluster1::> vserver vscan on-demand-task schedule -vserver vs2 -task-name Task2 -schedule daily
[Job 142]: Vscan On-Demand job is queued. Use the "job show -id 142" command to view the status.
----
+
To view the status of the job, use the `job show` command. The `job pause` and `job resume` commands, respectively pause and restart the job; the `job stop` command terminates the job.

. Verify that the on-demand task has been scheduled: 
+
`vserver vscan on-demand-task show -instance _data_SVM_ -task-name _task_name_`
+
For a complete list of options, see the man page for the command.
+
The following command displays the details for the `Task 2` task:
+
----
cluster1::> vserver vscan on-demand-task show -instance vs2 -task-name Task2

                           Vserver: vs2
                         Task Name: Task2
                List of Scan Paths: /vol1/, /vol2/cifs/

                     Scan Priority: low
                  Report Log Level: info

.After you finish

You must enable scanning on the SVM before the task is scheduled to run.
