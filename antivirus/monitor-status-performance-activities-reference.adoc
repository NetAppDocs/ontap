You can monitor the critical aspects of the Vscan module, such as the Vscan server connection status, 
the health of the Vscan servers, and the number of files that have been scanned. This information helps 
you diagnose issues related to the Vscan server.

== View Vscan server connection information

You can view the connection status of Vscan servers to manage the connections that are already in use 
and the connections that are available for use. Various commands display information 
about the connection status of Vscan servers.
|===

h| Command... h| Information displayed...
a|
`vserver vscan connection-status show`
a|
Summary of the connection status
a|
`vserver vscan connection-status show-all`
a|
Detailed information about the connection status
a|
`vserver vscan connection-status show-not-connected`
a|
Status of the connections that are available but not connected
a|
`vserver vscan connection-status show-connected`
a|
Information about the connected Vscan server
|===
Learn more about the commands described in this procedure in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/index.html[ONTAP command reference^].

== View Vscan server statistics

You can view Vscan server–specific statistics to monitor performance and diagnose issues related to 
virus scanning. You must collect a data sample before you can use the `statistics show` command to 
display the Vscan server statistics.
To complete a data sample, complete the following step:

.Step

. Run the `statistics start` command and the `optional statistics` stop command.

=== View statistics for Vscan server requests and latencies

You can use ONTAP `offbox_vscan` counters on a per-SVM basis to monitor the rate of Vscan 
server requests that are dispatched and received per second and the server latencies across all Vscan 
servers. To view these statistics, complete the following step:

.Step

. Run the statistics show `object offbox_vscan –instance SVM` command with the 
following counters:
+

|===

h| Counter... h| Information displayed...
a|
`scan_request_dispatched_rate` 
a|
Number of virus-scanning requests sent from ONTAP to the Vscan servers per second
a|
`scan_noti_received_rate`
a|
Number of virus-scanning requests received back by ONTAP from the Vscan servers per second
a|
`dispatch_latency`
a|
Latency within ONTAP to identify an available Vscan server and send the request to that Vscan server
a|
`scan_latency`
a|
Round-trip latency from ONTAP to the Vscan server, including the time for the scan to run

=== View statistics for individual Vscan server requests and latencies

You can use ONTAP `offbox_vscan_server` counters on a per-SVM, per–off-box Vscan server, 
and per-node basis to monitor the rate of dispatched Vscan server requests and the server latency on 
each Vscan server individually. To collect this information, complete the following step:

.Step

. Run the `statistics show –object offbox_vscan –instance 
SVM:servername:nodename` command with the following counters:
+

|===

h| Counter... h| Information displayed...
a|
`scan_request_dispatched_rate`
a|
Number of virus-scanning requests sent from ONTAP 
a|
`scan_latency`
a|

to the Vscan servers per second

=== View statistics for Vscan server utilization

You can also use ONTAP `offbox_vscan_server` counters to collect Vscan server–side utilization 
statistics. These statistics are tracked on a per-SVM, per–off-box Vscan server, and per-node basis. They 
include CPU utilization on the Vscan server, queue depth for scanning operations on the Vscan server 
(both current and maximum), used memory and used network.
These statistics are forwarded by the Antivirus Connector to the statistics counters within ONTAP. They 
are based on data that is polled every 20 seconds and must be collected multiple times for accuracy; 
otherwise, the values seen in the statistics reflect only the last polling. CPU utilization and queues are 
particularly important to monitor and analyze. A high value for an average queue can indicate that the 
Vscan server has a bottleneck.
To collect utilization statistics for the Vscan server on a per-SVM, per–off-box Vscan server, and per-node 
basis, complete the following step:

.Step

. Collect utilization statistics for the Vscan server 
+
Run the `statistics show –object offbox_vscan_server –instance 
SVM:servername:nodename` command with the following `offbox_vscan_server` counters:
|===

h| Counter... h| Information displayed...
a|
`scanner_stats_pct_cpu_used`
a|
CPU utilization on the Vscan server
a|
`scanner_stats_pct_input_queue_avg`
a|
Average queue of scan requests on the Vscan server
a|
`scanner_stats_pct_input_queue_hiwatermark`
a|
Peak queue of scan requests on the Vscan server
a|
`scanner_stats_pct_mem_used`
a|
Memory used on the Vscan server
a|
`scanner_stats_pct_network_used`
a|
Network used on the Vscan server
