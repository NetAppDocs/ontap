A scanner policy determines whether a scanner pool is active. You must apply a scanner policy to the primary and secondary scanner pools on each cluster in a MetroCluster configuration.

.About this task

* You can apply only one scanner policy to a scanner pool.
* If you created a scanner pool for all the SVMs in a cluster, you must apply a scanner policy on each SVM individually.
* For disaster recovery and MetroCluster configurations, you must apply a scanner policy to every scanner pool in the local cluster and remote cluster.  
* In the policy that you create for the local cluster, you must specify the local cluster in the `cluster` parameter. In the policy that you create for the remote cluster, you must specify the remote cluster in the `cluster` parameter. The remote cluster can then take over virus scanning operations in case of a disaster.

.Steps

. Apply a scanner policy:
+
`vserver vscan scanner-pool apply-policy -vserver _data_SVM_ -scanner-pool _scanner_pool_ -scanner-policy primary|secondary|idle -cluster _cluster_to_apply_policy_on_`
+
A scanner policy can have one of the following values:
+
* `Primary` specifies that the scanner pool is active.
* `Secondary` specifies that the scanner pool is active only if none of the Vscan servers in the primary scanner pool are connected.
* `Idle` specifies that the scanner pool is inactive.
+
[NOTE]
====
You must apply all scanner policies from the cluster containing the primary SVM.

The following commands apply scanner policies to the primary and secondary scanner pools on each cluster in a MetroCluster configuration:
+
----
cluster1::>vserver vscan scanner-pool apply-policy -vserver cifssvm1
-scanner-pool pool1_for_site1 -scanner-policy primary -cluster cluster1

cluster1::>vserver vscan scanner-pool apply-policy -vserver cifssvm1
-scanner-pool pool2_for_site1 -scanner-policy secondary -cluster cluster1

cluster1::>vserver vscan scanner-pool apply-policy -vserver cifssvm1
-scanner-pool pool1_for_site2 -scanner-policy primary -cluster cluster2

cluster1::>vserver vscan scanner-pool apply-policy -vserver cifssvm1
-scanner-pool pool2_for_site2 -scanner-policy secondary -cluster cluster2
----

. Verify that the scanner pool is active:
+
`vserver vscan scanner-pool show -vserver data_SVM|cluster_admin_SVM -scanner-pool scanner_pool`
+
For a complete list of options, see the man page for the command.
+
The following command displays the details for the scanner pool `pool1`:
+
----
cluster1::> vserver vscan scanner-pool show -vserver cifssvm1 -scanner-pool pool1_for_site1

                                    Vserver: cifssvm1
                               Scanner Pool: pool1_for_site1
                             Applied Policy: primary
                             Current Status: on
         Cluster on Which Policy Is Applied: cluster1
                  Scanner Pool Config Owner: vserver
       List of IPs of Allowed Vscan Servers:
List of Host Names of Allowed Vscan Servers: scan1
                   List of Privileged Users: cifs\u1,cifs\u2

You can use the `vserver vscan scanner-pool show-active` command to view the active scanner pools on an SVM. For complete command syntax, see the man page for the command.
