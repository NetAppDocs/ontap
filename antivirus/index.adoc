Vscan is an antivirus scanning solution developed by NetApp that allows customers to protect their data from being compromised by viruses or other malicious code.  

Vscan performs virus scans when clients access files over SMB. You can configure Vscan to scan on-demand or on a schedule. You can interact with Vscan using the ONTAP command-line interface (CLI) or ONTAP application programming interfaces (APIs).
