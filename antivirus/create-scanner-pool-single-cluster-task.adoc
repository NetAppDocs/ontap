[.lead]
A scanner pool defines the Vscan servers and privileged users that can connect to SVMs. 

.Before you begin

* SVMs and Vscan servers must be in the same domain or in trusted domains.
* Configure an ONTAP Antivirus Connector with the cluster management LIF.
* The list of privileged users must include the domain and user name the Vscan server uses to connect to the SVM.
* Once the scanner pool is configured, check the connection status to the servers.

.Steps

. Create a scanner pool:
+
`vserver vscan scanner-pool create -vserver cluster_admin_SVM -scanner-pool scanner_pool -hostnames Vscan_server_hostnames -privileged-users privileged_users`
+
 ** Specify a cluster admin SVM.
 ** Specify an IP address or FQDN for each Vscan server host name.
 ** Specify the domain and user name for each privileged user.
Learn more about the commands described in this procedure in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/[ONTAP command reference^].

. Verify that the scanner pool was created: 
+
`vserver vscan scanner-pool show -vserver cluster_admin_SVM_ -scanner-pool _scanner_pool_`
+

The following command displays the details for the `SP` scanner pool:

cluster1::> vserver vscan scanner-pool show -vserver cluster_admin_SVM -scanner-pool SP

                                    Vserver: cluster_admin_SVM
                               Scanner Pool: SP
                             Applied Policy: idle
                             Current Status: off
         Cluster on Which Policy Is Applied: -
                  Scanner Pool Config Owner: cluster
       List of IPs of Allowed Vscan Servers: 1.1.1.1, 10.72.204.27
List of Host Names of Allowed Vscan Servers: 1.1.1.1, vmwin204-27.fsct.nb
                   List of Privileged Users: cifs\u1, cifs\u2

You can also use the `vserver vscan scanner-pool show` command to view all the scanner pools on the cluster. Learn more about `vserver vscan scanner-pool show` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/vserver-vscan-scanner-pool-show.html[ONTAP command reference^].
