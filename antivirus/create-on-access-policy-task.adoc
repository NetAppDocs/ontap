An on-access policy defines the scope of an on-access scan. You can create an on-access policy for an individual SVM or for all the SVMs in a cluster. If you created an on-access policy for all the SVMs in a cluster, you must enable the policy on each SVM individually.

.About this task

* You can specify the maximum file size to scan, file extensions and paths to include in the scan, and file extensions and paths to exclude from the scan.
* You can set the `scan-mandatory` option to off to specify that file access is allowed when no Vscan servers are available for virus scanning.
* By default, ONTAP creates an on-access policy named "default_CIFS" and enables it for all the SVMs in a cluster.
* Any file that qualifies for scan exclusion based on the `paths-to-exclude`, `file-ext-to-exclude`, or `max-file-size` parameters is not considered for scanning, even if the `scan-mandatory` option is set to on. (Check this link:vscan-server-connection-concept.html[troubleshooting] section for connectivity issues related to the `scan-mandatory` option.)
* By default, only read-write volumes are scanned. You can specify filters that enable scanning of read-only volumes or that restrict scanning to files opened with execute access.
* Virus scanning is not performed on an SMB share for which the continuously-available parameter is set to Yes.
* See the link:architecture-concept.html[Antivirus architecture] section for details about the _Vscan file-operations profile_.
* You can create a maximum of ten (10) on-access policies per SVM. However, you can enable only one on-access policy at a time.
** You can exclude a maximum of one hundred (100) paths and file extensions from virus scanning in an on-access policy.
* Some file exclusion recommendations:
** Consider excluding large files (file size can be specified) from virus scanning because they can result in a slow response or scan request timeouts for CIFS users. The default file size for exclusion is 2GB.
** Consider excluding file extensions such as `.vhd` and `.tmp` because files with these extensions might not be appropriate for scanning.
** Consider excluding file paths such as the quarantine directory or paths in which only virtual hard drives or databases are stored.
** Verify that all exclusions are specified in the same policy, because only one policy can be enabled at a time. NetApp highly recommends having the same set of exclusions specified in the antivirus engine.
* An on-access policy is required for an xref:create-on-demand-task-task.html[on-demand scan]. To avoid on-access scanning for, you should set `-scan-files-with-no-ext` to false and `-file-ext-to-exclude` to * to exclude all extensions.  

.Steps

. Create an on-access policy:
+
`vserver vscan on-access-policy create -vserver _data_SVM|cluster_admin_SVM_ -policy-name _policy_name_ -protocol CIFS -max-file-size _max_size_of_files_to_scan_ â€“filters [scan-ro-volume,][scan-execute-access] -file-ext-to-include _extensions_of_files_to_include_ -file-ext-to-exclude _extensions_of_files_to_exclude_ -scan-files-with-no-ext true|false -paths-to-exclude _paths_of_files_to_exclude_ -scan-mandatory on|off`
+
 ** Specify a data SVM for a policy defined for an individual SVM, a cluster admin SVM for a policy defined for all the SVMs in a cluster.
 ** The `-file-ext-to-exclude` setting overrides the `-file-ext-to-include` setting.
 ** Set `-scan-files-with-no-ext` to true to scan files without extensions.
The following command creates an on-access policy named `Policy1` on the `vs1` SVM:

+
----
cluster1::> vserver vscan on-access-policy create -vserver vs1 -policy-name Policy1 -protocol CIFS -filters scan-ro-volume -max-file-size 3GB -file-ext-to-include "mp*","tx*" -file-ext-to-exclude "mp3","txt" -scan-files-with-no-ext false -paths-to-exclude "\vol\a b\","\vol\a,b\"
----
. Verify that the on-access policy has been created: `vserver vscan on-access-policy show -instance _data_SVM|cluster_admin_SVM_ -policy-name _name_`
+

The following command displays the details for the `Policy1` policy:
+
----
cluster1::> vserver vscan on-access-policy show -instance vs1 -policy-name Policy1

                           Vserver: vs1
                            Policy: Policy1
                     Policy Status: off
               Policy Config Owner: vserver
              File-Access Protocol: CIFS
                           Filters: scan-ro-volume
                    Mandatory Scan: on
Max File Size Allowed for Scanning: 3GB
            File Paths Not to Scan: \vol\a b\, \vol\a,b\
       File Extensions Not to Scan: mp3, txt
           File Extensions to Scan: mp*, tx*
      Scan Files with No Extension: false
