[.lead]
You can use on-demand scanning to check files for viruses immediately or on a schedule. 

You might want to run scans only in off-peak hours, for example, or you might want to scan very large files that were excluded from an on-access scan. You can use a cron schedule to specify when the task runs.

[NOTE] 
To create an on-demand task, there must be at least one on-access policy enabled. It can be the default policy or a user created on-access policy.

.About this topic
