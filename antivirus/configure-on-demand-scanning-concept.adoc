You can use on-demand scanning to check files for viruses immediately or on a schedule. You might want to run scans only in off-peak hours, for example, or you might want to scan very large files that were excluded from an on-access scan.

You can use a cron schedule to specify when the task runs:

* You can assign a schedule when you create a task.
* You can create a task without assigning a schedule, and use the `vserver vscan on-demand-task schedule` command to assign a schedule.
* You can use the `vserver vscan on-demand-task run` command to run a task immediately, whether or not you have assigned a schedule.

Only one task can be scheduled at a time on an SVM.

[NOTE]
====
On-demand scanning does not support scanning of symbolic links or stream files.
