= Configure the ONTAP Mediator for SnapMirror active sync

:hardbreaks:
:nofooter:
:icons: font

:imagesdir: ../media/


[.lead]
SnapMirror active sync uses peered clusters to protect your data in the event of a failover scenario. ONTAP Mediator is a key resource that enables business continuity by monitoring the health of each cluster. To configure SnapMirror active sync, you must first install ONTAP Mediator and verify that your primary and secondary clusters are configured properly. 

Once you have installed ONTAP Mediator and configured your clusters, <<initialize-the-ontap-mediator, initialize ONTAP Mediator for SnapMirror active sync using self-signed certificates>>. You must then xref:protect-task.html[create, initialize, and map the consistency group for SnapMirror active sync].

== ONTAP Mediator 

ONTAP Mediator provides a persistent and fenced store for high availability (HA) metadata used by the ONTAP clusters in a SnapMirror active sync relationship. Additionally, ONTAP Mediator provides a synchronous node health query functionality to aid in quorum determination and serves as a ping proxy for controller liveliness detection.

Each cluster peer relationship can only be associated with a single ONTAP Mediator instance. HA Mediator instances aren't supported. When a cluster is in several peer relationships with other clusters, the following ONTAP Mediator options are available:

* If SnapMirror active sync is configured on each relationship, each cluster peer relationship can have its own unique ONTAP Mediator instance.

* The cluster can use the same ONTAP Mediator instance for all peer relationships. 

For example, if cluster B has a peer relationship with cluster A, cluster C, and cluster D, all three cluster peer relationships can have a unique associated ONTAP Mediator instance when SnapMirror active sync is configured on each relationship. Alternatively, cluster B can use the same ONTAP Mediator instance for all three peer relationships. In this scenario, the same instance of ONTAP Mediator is listed three times for the cluster.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.17.1, you can configure link:cloud-mediator-config-task.html[ONTAP Cloud Mediator] to monitor the health of your cluster in a SnapMirror active sync configuration, however, you cannot use both Mediators at the same time. 
 
.Prerequisites for ONTAP Mediator
* ONTAP Mediator includes its own set of prerequisites. You must meet these prerequisites before installing ONTAP Mediator.
+

For more information, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/install-ip/concept_mediator_requirements.html[Prepare to install the ONTAP Mediator service^].
* By default, the ONTAP Mediator provides service through TCP port 31784. You should make sure that port 31784 is open and available between the ONTAP clusters and the ONTAP Mediator.


== Install ONTAP Mediator and confirm cluster configuration 

Perform each of the following steps to install ONTAP Mediator and verify the cluster configuration. For each step, you should confirm that the specific configuration has been performed. Each step includes a link to the specific procedure that you need to follow.

.Steps

. Install ONTAP Mediator before verifying that your source and destination clusters are configured correctly.
+
xref:../mediator/index.html[Prepare to install or upgrade ONTAP Mediator]

. Confirm that a cluster peering relationship exists between the clusters.
+
NOTE: The default IPspace is required by SnapMirror active sync for cluster peer relationships. A custom IPspace isn't supported.
+

== Initialize ONTAP Mediator for SnapMirror active sync using self-signed certificates

Once you have installed ONTAP Mediator and confirmed you cluster configuration, you must initialize ONTAP Mediator for cluster monitoring. You can initialize ONTAP Mediator using System Manager or the ONTAP CLI. 

=== System Manager 
With System Manager, you can configure ONTAP Mediator for automated failover. You can also replace the self-signed SSL and CA with the third party validated SSL Certificate and CA if you have not already done so.

=== CLI 

You can initialize ONTAP Mediator from either the primary or secondary cluster using the ONTAP CLI. When you issue the `mediator add` command on one cluster, ONTAP Mediator is automatically added on the other cluster.

When using ONTAP Mediator to monitor a SnapMirror active sync relationship, ONTAP Mediator cannot be initialized in ONTAP without a valid self-signed or certificate authority (CA) certificate. You add a valid certificate to the certificate store for peered clusters. When using ONTAP Mediator to monitor MetroCluster IP systems, HTTPS isn't used after the initial configuration; therefore, certificates aren't required.

== Re-initialize ONTAP Mediator with third-party certificates

You might need to re-initialize ONTAP Mediator. There might be situations that require the re-initialization of ONTAP Mediator such as a change in the ONTAP Mediator IP address, certificate expiration, and so on.

The following procedure illustrates the re-initialization of ONTAP Mediator for a specific case when a self-signed certificate needs to be replaced by a third-party certificate. 

.About this task

You need to replace the SnapMirror active sync cluster's self-signed certificates with third-party certificates, remove the ONTAP Mediator configuration from ONTAP, and then add ONTAP Mediator.

=== System Manager
With System Manager, you need to remove the ONTAP Mediator version configured with the old self-signed certificate from the ONTAP cluster and re-configure the ONTAP cluster with the new third-party certificate.

.Steps

. Select the menu options icon and select *Remove* to remove ONTAP Mediator. 
+
[NOTE]
This step does not remove the self-signed server-ca from the ONTAP cluster. NetApp recommends navigating to the *Certificate* tab and removing it manually before performing the next step below to add a third-party certificate:
+
image:remove-mediator.png[system manager mediator remove]

. Add ONTAP Mediator again with the correct certificate.

ONTAP Mediator is now configured with the new third-party self-signed certificate.

image:configure-mediator-system-manager.png[system manager mediator add]

=== CLI
You can re-initialize ONTAP Mediator from either the primary or secondary cluster by using the ONTAP CLI to replace the self-signed certificate with the third-party certificate.

. Remove the self-signed `intermediate.crt` installed earlier when you used self-signed certificates for all clusters. In the example below, there are two clusters:
+
Example:
+
----
 C1_test_cluster::*> security certificate delete -vserver C1_test_cluster -common-name ONTAPMediatorCA
 2 entries were deleted.

 C2_test_cluster::*> security certificate delete -vserver C2_test_cluster -common-name ONTAPMediatorCA *
 2 entries were deleted.
----

. Remove the previously configured ONTAP Mediator from the SnapMirror active sync cluster using `-force true`:
+
Example:
+
-----
C1_test_cluster::*> snapmirror mediator show
Mediator Address Peer Cluster     Connection Status Quorum Status
---------------- ---------------- ----------------- -------------
1.2.3.4          C2_test_cluster   connected         true

C1_test_cluster::*> snapmirror mediator remove -mediator-address 1.2.3.4 -peer-cluster C2_test_cluster -force true

Warning: You are trying to remove the ONTAP Mediator configuration with force. If this configuration exists on the peer cluster, it could lead to failure of a SnapMirror failover operation. Check if this configuration
         exists on the peer cluster C2_test_cluster and remove it as well.
