= Configure the ONTAP Mediator and clusters for SnapMirror active sync
:hardbreaks:
:nofooter:
:icons: font
:linkattrs:
:imagesdir: ../media/


[.lead]
SnapMirror active sync utilizes peered clusters to ensure your data is available in the event of a failover scenario. The ONTAP Mediator is a key resource ensuring business continuity, monitoring the health of each cluster. To configure SnapMirror active sync, you must first install the ONTAP Mediator and ensure your primary and secondary clusters are configured properly. 

Once you have installed the ONTAP Mediator and configured your clusters, you must <<initialize-the-ontap-mediator>> the ONTAP Mediator for use with SnapMirror active sync. You must then xref:protect-task.html[create, initialize, and map the consistency group for SnapMirror active sync].

== ONTAP Mediator 

The ONTAP Mediator provides a persistent and fenced store for high availability (HA) metadata used by the ONTAP clusters in a SnapMirror active sync relationship. Additionally, ONTAP Mediator provides a synchronous node health query functionality to aid in quorum determination and serves as a ping proxy for controller liveliness detection.

.Prerequisites for the ONTAP Mediator
* The ONTAP Mediator includes its own set of prerequisites. You must meet these prerequisites before installing the mediator.
+
For more information, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/install-ip/task_configuring_the_ontap_mediator_service_from_a_metrocluster_ip_configuration.html[Prepare to install the ONTAP Mediator service^].
* By default, the ONTAP Mediator provides service through TCP port 31784. You should make sure that port 31784 is open and available between the ONTAP clusters and the mediator.

== Install the ONTAP Mediator and confirm cluster configuration 

Proceed through each of the following steps. For each step, you should confirm that the specific configuration has been performed. Use the link included after each step to get more information as needed.

.Steps

. Install the ONTAP Mediator service before you ensure that your source and destination clusters are configured properly.
+
xref:../mediator/index.html[Prepare to install or upgrade the ONTAP Mediator service]

. Confirm that a cluster peering relationship exists between the clusters.
+
NOTE: The default IPspace is required by SnapMirror active sync for cluster peer relationships. A custom IPspace is not supported.
+
xref:../task_dp_prepare_mirror.html[Configure peer relationships]

. Confirm that the Storage VMs are created on each cluster.
+
xref:../smb-config/create-svms-data-access-task.html[Creating an SVM]

. Confirm that a peer relationship exists between the Storage VMs on each cluster.
+
xref:../peering/create-intercluster-svm-peer-relationship-93-later-task.html[Creating an SVM peering relationship]

. Confirm that the volumes exist for your LUNs.
+
xref:../smb-config/create-volume-task.html[Creating a volume]

. Confirm that at least one SAN LIF is created on each node in the cluster.
+
link:../san-admin/manage-lifs-all-san-protocols-concept.html[Considerations for LIFs in a cluster SAN environment]
+
link:../networking/create_a_lif.html[Creating a LIF]

. Confirm that the necessary LUNs are created and mapped to an igroup, which is used to map LUNs to the initiator on the application host.
+
xref:../san-admin/provision-storage.html[Create LUNs and map igroups]

. Rescan the application host to discover any new LUNs.

== Initialize the ONTAP Mediator for SnapMirror active sync using self-signed certificates

Once you have installed the ONTAP Mediator and confirmed you cluster configuration, you must initialize the ONTAP Mediator for cluster monitoring. You can initialize the ONTAP Mediator using System Manager or the ONTAP CLI. 

=== System Manager 
With System Manager, you can configure the ONTAP Mediator server for automated failover. You can also replace the self-signed SSL and CA with the third party validated SSL Certificate and CA if you have not already done so.

=== CLI 

You can initialize the ONTAP Mediator from either the primary or secondary cluster using the ONTAP CLI. When you issue the `mediator add` command on one cluster, the ONTAP Mediator is automatically added on the other cluster.

When using Mediator to monitor a SnapMirror active sync relationship, Mediator cannot be initialized in ONTAP without a valid self-signed or certificate authority (CA) certificate. You add a valid certificate to the certificate store for peered clusters. When using Mediator to monitor MetroCluster IP systems, HTTPS is not used after the initial configuration; therefore, certificates are not required.

== Re-initialize ONTAP Mediator with third-party certificates

You might need to re-initialize the ONTAP Mediator service. There might be situations that require the re-initialization of the ONTAP Mediator service such as a change in the ONTAP Mediator IP address, certificate expiration, and more.

The following procedure illustrates the re-initialization of ONTAP Mediator for a specific case when a self-signed certificate needs to be replaced by a third-party certificate. 

.About this task

You need to replace the SM-BC cluster's self-signed certificates with third-party certificates, remove the ONTAP Mediator configuration from ONTAP, and then add the ONTAP Mediator.

=== System Manager
With System Manager, you need to remove the ONTAP Mediator configured with the old self-signed certificate from the ONTAP cluster and re-configure the ONTAP cluster with the new third-party certificate.

.Steps

. Select the menu options icon and select *Remove* to remove the ONTAP Mediator. 
+
[NOTE]
This step does not remove the self-signed server-ca from the ONTAP cluster. NetApp recommends navigating to the *Certificate* tab and removing it manually before performing the next step below to add a third-party certificate:
+
image:remove-mediator.png[system manager mediator remove]

. Add the ONTAP Mediator again with the correct certificate.

The ONTAP Mediator is now configured with the new third-party self-signed certificate.

image:configure-mediator-system-manager.png[system manager mediator add]

=== CLI
You can re-initialize the ONTAP Mediator from either the primary or secondary cluster by using the ONTAP CLI to replace the self-signed certificate with the third-party certificate.

. Remove the self-signed `intermediate.crt` installed earlier when you used self-signed certificates for all clusters. In the example below, there are two clusters:
+
*Example*
+
----
 C1_test_cluster::*> security certificate delete -vserver C1_test_cluster -common-name ONTAPMediatorCA
 2 entries were deleted.

 C2_test_cluster::*> security certificate delete -vserver C2_test_cluster -common-name ONTAPMediatorCA *
 2 entries were deleted.
----

. Remove the previously configured ONTAP Mediator from the SM-BC cluster using `-force true`:
+
*Example*
+
-----
C1_test_cluster::*> snapmirror mediator show
Mediator Address Peer Cluster     Connection Status Quorum Status
---------------- ---------------- ----------------- -------------
1.2.3.4          C2_test_cluster   connected         true

C1_test_cluster::*> snapmirror mediator remove -mediator-address 1.2.3.4 -peer-cluster C2_test_cluster -force true

Warning: You are trying to remove the ONTAP Mediator configuration with force. If this configuration exists on the peer cluster, it could lead to failure of a SnapMirror failover operation. Check if this configuration
         exists on the peer cluster C2_test_cluster and remove it as well.
