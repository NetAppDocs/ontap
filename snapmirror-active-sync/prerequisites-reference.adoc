[.lead]
When planning your SnapMirror active sync deployment, ensure you have met the various hardware, software, and system configuration requirements. 

== Hardware

The following table outlines the supported NetApp cluster configurations. 

[cols="25,25,25,25"]
|===

h| Cluster type h| Supported models h| Supported features h| Maximum supported cluster nodes

a| AFF
a| A-Series, C-Series
a| Automated Failover Duplex (Symmetric Active/Active), Automated Failover (Asymmetric Active/Active)
a| 
* 2 (ONTAP 9.9.1 or later)  
* 4 (ONTAP 9.16.1 with Symmetric AA configurations)

a| ASA
a| A-Series, C-Series
a| Automated Failover Duplex (Symmetric AA), Automated Failover (Asymmetric AA)
a| 
* 2 (ONTAP 9.9.1 or later 
* 4 (ONTAP 9.16.1 with Symmetric AA configurations)

a| ASA r2 
a| All
a| Automated Failover Duplex (Symmetric AA)
a| 2

The table below outlines the capability for replication between cluster types.

[cols="33,33,33"]
|===

h| Cluster type 1 h| Cluster type 2 h| Replication supported?

a| A-Series
a| C-Series
a| Yes 


a| AFF
a| ASA
a| No 

a| ASA 
a| ASA r2
a| No

a| ASA r2
a| ASA r2
a| Yes

|===


== Software
* ONTAP 9.9.1 or later
* ONTAP Mediator 1.2 or later
* A Linux server or virtual machine for the ONTAP Mediator running one of the following:

include::../_include/mediator-linux-support.adoc[]

== Licensing

* SnapMirror synchronous license must be applied on both clusters.
* SnapMirror license must be applied on both clusters.
+
[NOTE]
If your ONTAP storage systems were purchased before June 2019, see link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/systems/master-license-keys[NetApp ONTAP Master License Keys^] to get the required SnapMirror synchronous license.

== Networking environment

* Inter-cluster latency round trip time (RTT) must be less than 10 milliseconds.
* Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, link:https://kb.netapp.com/onprem/ontap/da/SAN/What_are_SCSI_Reservations_and_SCSI_Persistent_Reservations[SCSI-3 persistent reservations] are supported with SnapMirror active sync.

== Supported protocols
SnapMirror active sync supports SAN protocols. 

* The FC and iSCSI protocols are supported beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1.
* The NVMe protocol is supported beginning with ONTAP 9.17.1.
+
SnapMirror active sync does not support the following with the NVMe protocol:

** 4-node symmetric active/active configurations 
** Changes in consistency group size 
+
You cannot expand or shrink a consistency group when using the NVMe protocol with SnapMirror active sync.   
** Coexistence of LUNs and namespaces in the same consistency group is not supported.

== IPspace

The default IPspace is required by SnapMirror active sync for cluster peer relationships. Custom IPspace is not supported.

== NTFS Security Style

NTFS security style is *not* supported on SnapMirror active sync volumes.

== ONTAP Mediator
* The ONTAP Mediator must be provisioned externally and attached to ONTAP for transparent application failover.
* To be fully functional and to enable automatic unplanned failover, the external ONTAP mediator should be provisioned and configured with ONTAP clusters.
* The ONTAP Mediator must be installed in a third failure domain, separate from the two ONTAP clusters.
* When installing the ONTAP Mediator, you should replace the self-signed certificate with a valid certificate signed by a mainstream reliable CA.
* For more information about the ONTAP Mediator, see link:../mediator/index.html[Prepare to install the ONTAP Mediator service].

== Other prerequisites 

* SnapMirror active sync relationships are not supported on read-write destination volumes. Before you can use a read-write volume, you must convert it to a DP volume by creating a volume-level SnapMirror relationship and then deleting the relationship. For details, see link:convert-active-sync-task.html[Convert an existing SnapMirror relationships to SnapMirror active sync].
* Storage VMs using SnapMirror active sync cannot be joined to Active Directory as a client computed.
