[.lead]
When planning your SnapMirror active sync deployment, ensure you have met the various hardware, software, and system configuration requirements. 

== Hardware

* Only two-node HA clusters are supported.
* Both clusters must be either AFF (A-Series and C-Series) or ASA (A-Series and C-Series). Mixing between AFF and ASA is not supported. Replication is supported between AFF A-Series and C-Series. 

== Software
* ONTAP 9.9.1 or later
* ONTAP Mediator 1.2 or later
* A Linux server or virtual machine for the ONTAP Mediator running one of the following:

include::../_include/mediator-linux-support.adoc[]

== Licensing

* SnapMirror synchronous license must be applied on both clusters.
* SnapMirror license must be applied on both clusters.

[NOTE]
If your ONTAP storage systems were purchased before June 2019, see link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/systems/master-license-keys[NetApp ONTAP Master License Keys^] to get the required SnapMirror synchronous license.

== Networking environment

* Inter-cluster latency round trip time (RTT) must be less than 10 milliseconds.
* Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, link:https://kb.netapp.com/onprem/ontap/da/SAN/What_are_SCSI_Reservations_and_SCSI_Persistent_Reservations[SCSI-3 persistent reservations] are supported with SnapMirror active sync.

== Supported protocols

* Only SAN protocols are supported (not NFS/SMB).
* Only Fibre Channel and iSCSI protocols are supported. 
* The default IPspace is required by SnapMirror active sync for cluster peer relationships. Custom IPspace is not supported.

== NTFS Security Style

NTFS security style is *not* supported on SnapMirror active sync volumes.

== ONTAP Mediator
* The ONTAP Mediator must be provisioned externally and attached to ONTAP for transparent application failover.
* To be fully functional and to enable automatic unplanned failover, the external ONTAP mediator should be provisioned and configured with ONTAP clusters.
* The ONTAP Mediator must be installed in a third failure domain, separate from the two ONTAP clusters.
* When installing the ONTAP Mediator, you should replace the self-signed certificate with a valid certificate signed by a mainstream reliable CA.
* For more information about the ONTAP Mediator, see link:../mediator/index.html[Prepare to install the ONTAP Mediator service].

== Read-write destination volumes

* SnapMirror active sync relationships are not supported on read-write destination volumes. Before you can use a read-write volume, you must convert it to a DP volume by creating a volume-level SnapMirror relationship and then deleting the relationship. For details, see link:convert-active-sync-task.html[Convert an existing SnapMirror relationships to SnapMirror active sync].
