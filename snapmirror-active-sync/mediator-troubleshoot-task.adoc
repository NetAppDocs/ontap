.Issue:

After executing the `snapmirror failover start` command, the output for the `snapmirror failover show` command displays a message indicating that either the ONTAP Mediator or ONTAP Cloud Mediator is not configured.

See link:mediator-install-task.html[Configure the ONTAP Mediator and clusters for SnapMirror active sync] or link:cloud-mediator-config-task.html[Configure the ONTAP Cloud Mediator for SnapMirror active sync].

.Example:

....
Cluster1::> snapmirror failover show
Source Destination Error
Path Path Type Status start-time end-time Reason
-------- ----------- -------- --------- ---------- ---------- ----------
vs0:/cg/cg vs1:/cg/cg planned failed 10/1/2020 10/1/2020 SnapMirror failover cannot start because the source-side precheck failed. reason: Mediator not configured.
05:50:42 05:50:43
....

.Cause:

Mediator is not configured or there are network connectivity issues.

.Solution:

If the ONTAP Mediator is not configured, you must configure the ONTAP Mediator before you can establish a SnapMirror active sync relationship. Fix any network connectivity issues. Make sure Mediator is connected and quorum status is true on both the source and destination site using the snapmirror mediator show command. For more information, see link:mediator-install-task.html[Configure the ONTAP Mediator].

.Example:

....
cluster::> snapmirror mediator show
Mediator Address Peer Cluster     Connection Status Quorum Status
---------------- ---------------- ----------------- -------------
10.234.10.143    cluster2         connected         true
