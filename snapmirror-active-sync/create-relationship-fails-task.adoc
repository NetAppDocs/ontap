.Issue:

Creation of SnapMirror relationship and consistency group initialization fails.

.Solution:

Ensure that you have not exceeded the limit of consistency groups per cluster. Consistency group limits in SnapMirror active sync are platform independent and differ based on the version of ONTAP. See link:limits-reference.html[Object limits] for guidance specific to your ONTAP version. 

.Error:
If the consistency group is stuck initializing, check the status of your consistency group initializations with the ONTAP REST API, System Manager or the command `sn show -expand`.

include::../_include/snapmirror-active-sync-name.adoc[]

.Solution:
If consistency groups fail to initialize, remove the SnapMirror active sync relationship, delete the consistency group, then recreate the relationship and initialize it. This workflow differs depending on the version of ONTAP you are using.
