.Issue:

Creation of SnapMirror relationship and consistency group initialization fails.

.Solution:

Ensure that you have not exceeded the limit of consistency groups per cluster. Consistency group limits in SM-BC are platform independent and differ based on the version of ONTAP. See link:smbc_plan_additional_restrictions_and_limitations.html[Additional restrictions and limitations] for limitations based on ONTAP version. 

.Error:
If the consistency group is stuck initializing, check the status of your consistency group initializations with the ONTAP REST API, System Manager or the command `sn show -expand`.

include::../_include/snapmirror-active-sync-name.adoc[]

.Solution:
If consistency groups fail to initialize, remove the SM-BC relationship, delete the consistency group, then recreate the relationship and initialize it. This workflow differs depending on the version of ONTAP you are using.

. Under *Protection > Relationships*, find the SM-BC relationship on the consistency group. Select image:../media/icon_kabob.gif[three stacked vertical dots icon], then *Delete* to remove the SM-BC relationship.
