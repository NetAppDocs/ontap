.Issue:

The SnapMirror release operation fails when the snapshot cannot be deleted.

.Solution:

The snapshot contains a transient tag. Use the `snapshot delete` command with the `-ignore-owners` option to remove the transient snapshot.
`snapshot delete -volume <volume_name> -snapshot <snapshot_name> -ignore-owners true -force true`

Retry the `snapmirror release` command.
