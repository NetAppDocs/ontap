[.lead]
SnapMirror active sync is compatible with numerous operating systems, application hosts, and other features in ONTAP.

NOTE: For specific supportability and interoperability details not covered here, consult the Interoperability Matrix Tool (http://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix[IMT^]).

== Application hosts

SnapMirror active sync support applications hosts including Hyper-V, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), VMware, VMware vSphere Metro Storage Cluster (vMSC), Windows Server, and, beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, Windows Server Failover Cluster. 

== Operating systems  

SnapMirror active sync is supported with numerous operating systems, including: 

* AIX via PVR (beginning ONTAP 9.11.1)
* HP-UX (beginning ONTAP 9.10.1)
* Solaris 11.4 (beginning ONTAP 9.10.1)

=== AIX

Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, AIX is supported with SnapMirror active sync via PVR. 

SnapMirror active sync can provide zero RPO data protection, but the failover process with AIX requires additional steps to recognize the path change. LUNs that are not part of a root volume group will experience an I/O pause until a `cfgmgr` command is run. This can be automated, and most applications will resume operations without further disruption. 

LUNs that are part of a root volume group should generally not be protected with SnapMirror active sync. It's not possible to run the `cfgmgr` command after a failover, meaning that a reboot is required to recognize the changes in SAN paths. You can still achieve zero RPO data protection of the root volume group, but failover will be disruptive.

Consult your NetApp account team for further information about SnapMirror active sync with AIX. 

=== HP-UX

Beginning in ONTAP 9.10.1, SnapMirror active sync for HP-UX is supported.

.Automatic unplanned failover with HP-UX

An automatic unplanned failover (AUFO) event on the isolated master cluster may be caused by dual event failure when the connection between the primary and the secondary cluster is lost and the connection between the primary cluster and the mediator is also lost. This is considered a rare event, unlike other AUFO events.

* In this scenario, it might take more than 120 seconds for I/O to resume on the HP-UX host. Depending on the applications that are running, this might not lead to any I/O disruption or error messages.
* To remediate, you must restart applications on the HP-UX host that have a disruption tolerance of less than 120 seconds.

=== Solaris

Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, SnapMirror active sync supports Solaris 11.4.

To ensure the Solaris client applications are non-disruptive when an unplanned site failover switchover occurs in an SnapMirror active sync environment, modify the default Solaris OS settings. To configure Solaris with the recommended settings, see the Knowledge Base article link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Protection_and_Security/SnapMirror/Solaris_Host_support_recommended_settings_in_SnapMirror_Business_Continuity_(SM-BC)_configuration[Solaris Host support recommended settings in SnapMirror active sync^].

== ONTAP interoperability 

SnapMirror active sync integrates with components of ONTAP to extends its data protection capabilities. 

=== FabricPool 

SnapMirror active sync supports source and destination volumes on FabricPool aggregates with tiering policies of None, Snapshot or Auto. SnapMirror active sync does not support FabricPool aggregates using a tiering policy of All.

=== Fan-out configurations

In xref:../data-protection/supported-deployment-config-concept.html[fan-out configurations], your source volume can be mirrored to a SnapMirror active sync destination endpoint and to one or more SnapMirror asynchronous relationships.

SnapMirror active sync supports xref:../data-protection/supported-deployment-config-concept.html[fan-out configurations] with the `MirrorAllSnapshots` policy and, beginning in ONTAP 9.11.1, the `MirrorAndVault` policy. Fan-out configurations are not supported in SnapMirror active sync with the `XDPDefault` policy. 

Beginning with ONTAP 9.15.1, SnapMirror active sync supports automatic reconfiguration in the fan-out leg after a failover event. If the failover from the primary to the secondary site has succeeded, the tertiary site is automatically reconfigured to treat the secondary site as the source. Reconfiguration is triggered by either a planned or unplanned failover. Reconfiguration also occurs upon failback to the primary site. 

For information about managing your fan-out configuration in earlier releases of ONTAP, see xref:recover-unplanned-failover-task.adoc[resume protection in the fan-out configuration].

=== NDMP restore

Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, you can use xref:../tape-backup/transfer-data-ndmpcopy-task.html[NDMP to copy and restore data] with SnapMirror active sync. Using NDMP allows you to move data onto the SnapMirror active sync source to complete a restore without pausing protection. This is particularly useful in fan-out configurations. 

=== SnapCenter 

SnapMirror active sync is supported with SnapCenter beginning with link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/snapcenter/index.html[SnapCenter 5.0^]. SnapCenter enables the creation of Snapshots that can be used to protect and recover applications and virtual machines, enabling always available storage solutions with application-level granularity.

=== SnapRestore 

SnapMirror active sync supports partial and single file SnapRestore. 

.Single file SnapRestore
Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, xref:../data-protection/restore-single-file-snapshot-task.html[single-file SnapRestore] is supported for SnapMirror active sync volumes. You can restore a single file from a snapshot replicated from the SnapMirror active sync source to the destination. Because volumes can contain one or more LUNs, this feature helps you implement a less disruptive restore operation, granularly restoring a single LUN without disrupting the other LUNs. Single File SnapRestore has two options: in-place and out-of-place.

.Partial file SnapRestore
Beginning in ONTAP 9.12.1, link:../data-protection/restore-part-file-snapshot-task.html[partial LUN restore] is supported for SnapMirror active sync volumes. You can restore a data from application-created snapshots that have been replicated between the SnapMirror active sync source (volume) and the destination (snapshot) volumes. Partial LUN or file restore may be necessary if you need to restore a database on a host that stores multiple databases on the same LUN. Using this functionality requires you to know the starting byte offset of the data and byte count.

=== Large LUNs and large volumes

Support for large LUNs and large volumes (greater than 100 TB) depends on the version of ONTAP you are using and your platform.

====

.ONTAP 9.12.1P2 and later
--
* For ONTAP 9.12.1 P2 and later, SnapMirror active sync supports Large LUNs and large volumes greater than 100 TB on ASA and AFF (A-Series and C-Series). Primary and secondary clusters must be of the same type: either ASA or AFF. Replication from AFF A-Series to AFF C-Series and vice versa is supported. 

[NOTE]
For ONTAP Releases 9.12.1P2 and later, you must ensure that both the primary and secondary clusters are either All-Flash SAN Arrays (ASA) or All Flash Array (AFF), and that they both have ONTAP 9.12.1 P2 or later installed. If the secondary cluster is running a version earlier than ONTAP 9.12.1P2 or if the array type is not the same as primary cluster, the synchronous relationship can go out of sync if the primary volume grows larger than 100 TB.
--

.ONTAP 9.9.1 - 9.12.1P1
--
* For ONTAP releases between ONTAP 9.9.1 and 9.12.1 P1 (inclusive), Large LUNs and large volumes greater than 100TB are supported only on All-Flash SAN Arrays. Replication from AFF A-Series to AFF C-Series and vice versa is supported.

[NOTE]
For ONTAP releases between ONTAP 9.9.1 and 9.12.1 P2, you must ensure that both the primary and secondary clusters are All-Flash SAN Arrays, and that they both have ONTAP 9.9.1 or later installed. If the secondary cluster is running a version earlier than ONTAP 9.9.1 or if it is not an All-Flash SAN Array, the synchronous relationship can go out of sync if the primary volume grows larger than 100 TB.
