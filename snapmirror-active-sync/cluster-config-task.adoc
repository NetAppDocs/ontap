SnapMirror active sync uses peered clusters to protect your data in the event of a failover scenario. Before you configure ONTAP Mediator or ONTAP Cloud Mediator for SnapMirror active sync, you must first ensure the cluster is configured correctly.

.Before you begin

Before you configure ONTAP Mediator or ONTAP Cloud Mediator, you should confirm the following:

. A cluster peering relationship exists between the clusters.
+
NOTE: The default IPspace is required by SnapMirror active sync for cluster peer relationships. A custom IPspace isn't supported.

. The SVMs are created on each cluster.

. A peer relationship exists between the SVMs on each cluster.

. The volumes exist for your LUNs.

. At least one SAN LIF (either FC or iSCSI as applicable) is created on each node in both clusters.

. The necessary LUNs are created and mapped to an igroup, which is used to map LUNs to the initiator on the application host.

. The application host is re-scanned to discover any new LUNs.
