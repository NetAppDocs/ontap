SnapMirror active sync offers asymmetric protection and, beginning with ONTAP 9.15.1, symmetric active/active protection. 

== Configure asymmetric protection 

Configuring asymmetric protection using SnapMirror active sync involves selecting LUNs on the ONTAP source cluster and adding them to a consistency group. 

.Before you begin

* You must have a SnapMirror synchronous license.
* You must be a cluster or storage VM administrator.
* All constituent volumes in a consistency group must be in a single storage VM (SVM).
** LUNs can reside on different volumes.
* The source and destination cluster cannot be the same.
* You cannot establish SnapMirror active sync consistency group relationships across ASA clusters and non-ASA clusters.
* The default IPspace is required by SnapMirror active sync for cluster peer relationships. Custom IPspace is not supported.
* The name of the consistency group must be unique.
* The volumes on the secondary (destination) cluster must be type DP.
* The primary and the secondary SVMs must be in a peered relationship.

.Steps 

You can configure a consistency group using the ONTAP CLI or System Manager. 

Beginning in ONTAP 9.10.1, ONTAP offers a consistency group endpoint and menu in System Manager, offering additional management utilities. If you are using ONTAP 9.10.1 or later, see link:../consistency-groups/configure-task.html[Configure a consistency group] then link:../consistency-groups/protect-task.html[configure protection] to create an SnapMirror active sync relationship.

.System Manager
--
. On the primary cluster, navigate to *Protection > Overview > Protect for Business Continuity > Protect LUNs*.
. Select the LUNs you want to protect and add them to a protection group.
. Select the destination cluster and SVM.
. *Initialize relationship* is selected by default. Click *Save* to begin protection.
. Go to *Dashboard > Performance* to verify IOPS activity for the LUNs.
. On the destination cluster, use System Manager to verify that the protection for business continuity relationship is in sync: *Protection > Relationships*.

.CLI

. Create a consistency group relationship from the destination cluster.
`destination::> snapmirror create -source-path _source-path_ -destination-path _destination-path_ -cg-item-mappings _volume-paths_ -policy _policy-name_`
+
You can map up to 12 constituent volumes using the `cg-item-mappings` parameter on the `snapmirror create` command. 
+
The following example creates two consistency groups: `cg_src_ on the source with `vol1` and `vol2` and a mirrored destination consistency group, `cg_dst`.
+
`destination::> snapmirror create -source-path vs1_src:/cg/cg_src -destination-path vs1_dst:/cg/cg_dst -cg-item-mappings vol_src1:@vol_dst1,vol_src2:@vol_dst2 -policy AutomatedFailOver`
. From the destination cluster, initialize the consistency group.
+
`destination::>snapmirror initialize -destination-path _destination-consistency-group_`
. Confirm that the initialization operation completed successfully. The status should be `InSync`.
+
`snapmirror show`
. On each cluster, create an igroup so you can map LUNs to the initiator on the application host.
`lun igroup create -igroup _name_ -protocol _fcp|iscsi_ -ostype _os_ -initiator _initiator_name_`
+
. On each cluster, map LUNs to the igroup:
+
`lun map -path _path_name_ -igroup _igroup_name_`
. Verify the LUN mapping completed successfully with the `lun map` command. Then, you can discover the new LUNs on the application host.

== Configure symmetric active/active protection 

You can establish symmetric protection using System Manager or the ONTAP CLI. In both interfaces, there are different steps for xref:index.html#key-concepts[uniform and non-uniform configurations]. 

.Before you begin

* Both clusters must be running ONTAP 9.15.1 or later.
* Symmetric active/active configurations require the `AutomatedFailoverDuplex` protection policy. Alternately, you can xref:../data-protection/create-custom-replication-policy-concept.html[create a custom SnapMirror policy] provided the `-type` is `automated-failover-duplex`.
* In ONTAP 9.15.1, symmetric active/active is only supported on 2-node clusters. 
* Beginning with ONTAP 9.16.1 GA, SnapMirror active sync supports symmetric active/active configurations on four-node clusters. 
** To use SnapMirror active sync on a four-node cluster, you must be running ONTAP 9.16.1 GA or later.
** Before deploying a four-node configuration, you must xref:../peering/create-cluster-relationship-93-later-task.adoc[create a cluster peer relationship].
** Review the xref:limits-reference.adoc[limits] for four-node clusters. 
** If you revert to a two-node cluster, you must remove the SnapMirror active sync relationships from the cluster before reverting.
** You can use the four-node configuration to upgrade storage and controllers. This process is non-disruptive and expands the cluster while moving volumes into the new nodes. For more information, see link:upgrade-revert-task.html#refresh-a-cluster[refresh a cluster].

.Steps for a uniform configuration 
. Create a new SnapMirror relationship grouping all the volumes in the application. Ensure you designate the `AutomatedFailOverDuplex` policy to establish bidirectional sync replication.
+
`snapmirror create -source-path <source_path> -destination-path <destination_path> -cg-item-mappings <source_volume:@destination_volume> -policy AutomatedFailOverDuplex`
. Initialize the SnapMirror relationship: 
`snapmirror initialize -destination-path <destination-consistency-group>`
. Confirm the operation has succeeded by waiting for the `Mirrored State` to show as `SnapMirrored` and the `Relationship Status` as `Insync`.
+
`snapmirror show -destination-path <destination_path>`
. On your host, configure host connectivity with access to each cluster according to your needs. 
. Establish the igroup configuration. Set the preferred paths for initiators on the local cluster. Specify the option to replicate the configuration to the peer cluster for inverse affinity. 
+
`SiteA::> igroup create -vserver <svm_name> -ostype <os_type> -igroup <igroup_name> -replication-peer <peer_svm_name> -initiator <host>`
+
[NOTE]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.16.1, use the `-proximal-vserver local` parameter in this command. 
+
`SiteA::> igroup add -vserver <svm_name> -igroup <igroup_name> -ostype <os_type> -initiator <host>`
+
[NOTE]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.16.1, use the `-proximal-vserver peer` parameter in this command. 

. From the host, discover the paths and verify the hosts have an active/optimized path to the storage LUN from the preferred cluster. 
. Deploy the application and distribute the VM workloads across clusters to achieve the required load balancing. 

.Steps for a non-uniform configuration 
. Create a new SnapMirror relationship grouping all the volumes in the application. Ensure you designate the `AutomatedFailOverDuplex`" policy to establish bidirectional sync replication.
+
`snapmirror create -source-path <source_path> -destination-path <destination_path> -cg-item-mappings <source_volume:@destination_volume> -policy AutomatedFailOverDuplex`
. Initialize the SnapMirror relationship: 
`snapmirror initialize -destination-path <destination-consistency-group>`
. Confirm the operation has succeeded by waiting for the `Mirrored State` to show as `SnapMirrored` and the `Relationship Status` as `Insync`.
+
`snapmirror show -destination-path <destination_path>`
. On your host, configure host connectivity with access to each cluster according to your needs. 
. Establish the igroup configurations on both the source and destination clusters.
+
`# primary site
SiteA::> igroup create -vserver <svm_name> -igroup <igroup_name> -initiator <host_1_name_>`
+
`# secondary site
SiteB::> igroup create -vserver <svm_name> -igroup <igroup_name> -initiator <host_2_name>`
+
. From the host, discover the paths and verify the hosts have an active/optimized path to the storage LUN from the preferred cluster. 
. Deploy the application and distribute the VM workloads across clusters to achieve the required load balancing.
