= Volume move operation stuck when primary is down

[.lead]
.Issue:

A volume move operation is stuck indefinitely in cutover deferred state when the primary site is down in a SnapMirror active sync relationship.
When the primary site is down, the secondary site performs an automatic unplanned failover (AUFO). When a volume move operation is in progress when the AUFO is triggered the volume move becomes stuck.

.Solution:

Abort the volume move instance that is stuck and restart the volume move operation.
