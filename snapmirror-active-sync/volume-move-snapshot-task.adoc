Use the following information if the volume move reference snapshot shows as the newest for the SnapMirror relationship after a volume move operation.

.Issue:

After performing a volume move operation on a consistency group volume, the volume move reference snapshot might incorrectly display as the newest for the SnapMirror relationship.

You can view the newest snapshot with the following command:

`snapmirror show -fields newest-snapshot status -expand`

.Solution:

Manually perform a `snapmirror resync` or wait for the next automatic resync operation after the volume move operation completes.
