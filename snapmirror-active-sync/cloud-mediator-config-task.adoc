[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.17.1, you can use ONTAP Cloud Mediator to enable business continuity by monitoring the health of each cluster. ONTAP Cloud Mediator is a cloud-based service. When you use ONTAP Cloud Mediator with SnapMirror active sync, you must first confirm that BlueXP services and client information are configured and ensure proper cluster peering. 

As with ONTAP Mediator, ONTAP Cloud Mediator provides a persistent and fenced store for high availability (HA) metadata used by the ONTAP clusters in a SnapMirror active sync relationship. ONTAP Cloud Mediator provides a synchronous node health query functionality to aid in quorum determination and serves as a ping proxy for controller liveliness detection.

[IMPORTANT]
If you are using ONTAP Cloud Mediator with ONTAP 9.17.1 RC, when the connection between ONTAP Cloud Mediator and an ONTAP cluster consistently experiences high latency, SnapMirror active sync marks the Mediator connection status as `down-high-latency`. The Mediator is then excluded from SnapMirror active sync quorum processing for that cluster. If both ONTAP clusters in a SnapMirror active sync relationship experience high latency to the Mediator, the system activates primary-bias mode to prevent I/O disruptions during fault scenarios. After latency returns to normal levels, the Mediator status is updated to `connected`, however, primary-bias mode deactivation fails. This can prevent subsequent SnapMirror active sync failover operations from occurring and can cause I/O disruption in case of faults like primary failure. See more information, see the link:https://jira.ngage.netapp.com/browse/CONTAP-530483[public report].

.Before you begin

Before you configure ONTAP Cloud Mediator, you should confirm the following information:

* The cluster is configured.
+
link:cluster-config-task.html[Configure ONTAP clusters for SnapMirror active sync]

* You have a valid BlueXP subscription.
+
link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-subscribe-standard-mode.html[Subscribe to BlueXP data services (standard mode)] 

* You have copied your BlueXP organization ID from the BlueXP console and created a BlueXP member service account to use when you configure ONTAP Cloud Mediator. When you create the service account, the organization must be set to the subscription where you configured the ONTAP Cloud Mediator. The category must be set to *Application*, and the role type must be *ONTAP Mediator Setup Role*. You must save the client ID and client secret when you create the role.

.Steps

You can add ONTAP Cloud Mediator using System Manager or the ONTAP CLI.

====

.System Manager
--
. Navigate to *Protection > Overview > Mediator* and select *Add*.
. In the *Add a mediator* window, select *Cloud* as the mediator type and enter the following information:
+
* BlueXP organization ID
* BlueXP client ID
* BlueXP client secret
. Select the cluster peer.
. If you are using an HTTP proxy and it's not already configured, enter the HTTP proxy information for the local and remote hosts. 
+
It's recommended that you use a different proxy server for each cluster peer.
. Optional: If a root CA certificate needs to be installed in ONTAP, especially when using a proxy server, paste the certificate in the text box provided.  
. Select *Add*.
. Navigate to *Protection > Overview* and check the status of the relationship between the SnapMirror active sync clusters and ONTAP Cloud Mediator.

.CLI

. Configure ONTAP Cloud Mediator:
`snapmirror mediator add -peer-cluster <peerClusterName> -type cloud -bluexp-org-id <BlueXP Organization ID> -service-account-client-id <Service Account Client ID> -use-http-proxy-local <true|false> -use-http-proxy-remote <true|false>`

. Check ONTAP Cloud Mediator status:
`snapmirror mediator show`
+
Example:
+
----
C1_cluster::> snapmirror mediator show
Mediator Address Peer Cluster     Connection Status Quorum Status Type
---------------- ---------------- ----------------- ------------- -------
