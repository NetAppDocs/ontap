[.lead]
When preparing to use SnapMirror active sync, be aware of the following object limits. 

== Consistency groups in a cluster

Consistency group limits for a cluster with SnapMirror active sync are calculated based on relationships and depend on the version of ONTAP used. Limits are platform-independent. 

[options="header"]
|===
| ONTAP version | Maximum number of relationships
| ONTAP 9.11.1 and later | 50*
| ONTAP 9.10.1 | 20
| ONTAP 9.9.1 | 5
|===

{asterisk} Beginning with ONTAP 9.16.1, SnapMirror active sync supports 4-node clusters in symmetric active/active configurations. In a 4-node cluster, 100 consistency groups are supported. 

== Volumes per consistency group

The maximum number of volumes per consistency group with SnapMirror active sync is platform independent. 

[options="header"]
|===
| ONTAP version | Maximum number of volumes supported in a consistency group relationship
| ONTAP 9.15.1 and later | 80 
| ONTAP 9.10.1-9.14.1 | 16 
| ONTAP 9.9.1 | 12 
|===

== Volumes

Volume limits in SnapMirror active sync are calculated based on the number of endpoints, not the number of relationships. A consistency group with 12 volumes contributes 12 endpoints on both the primary and secondary cluster. Both SnapMirror active sync and SnapMirror synchronous relationships contribute to the total number of endpoints.

[IMPORTANT]
These limits apply to FAS, AFF, and current ASA systems. If you have an ASA r2 system (ASA A1K, ASA A70, or ASA A90), see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/asa-r2/monitor/view-insights.html[ASAr2 documentation^].

The maximum endpoints per platform are included in the following table.

[options="header"]
|===
| S. No |Platform 3+| Endpoints per HA for SnapMirror active sync 3+| Overall sync and SnapMirror active sync endpoints per HA
|
|
| ONTAP 9.11.1 and later | ONTAP 9.10.1 | ONTAP 9.9.1
| ONTAP 9.11.1 and later | ONTAP 9.10.1 | ONTAP 9.9.1
|1 | AFF | 400* | 200 | 60 |400 | 200 | 80
|2 | ASA | 400* | 200 | 60 | 400 | 200 | 80
|===

{asterisk} Beginning with ONTAP 9.16.1, SnapMirror active sync supports 4-node clusters in symmetric active/active configurations. The total limit for a 4-node cluster is 800 endpoints. 

== SAN object limits

SAN object limits are included in the following table. The limits apply regardless of the platform.

|===
|Object in an SnapMirror active sync relationship |Count

|LUNs per volume
a|* 256 (ONTAP 9.9.1 - ONTAP 9.15.0)
    * 512 (ONTAP 9.15.1 and later)
|Unique LUNs per 2-node cluster | 4,096
|Unique LUNs per 4-node cluster (available beginning with ONTAP 9.16.1) | 6,144
|LIFs per SVM (with at least one volume in an SnapMirror active sync relationship)
|256
|Inter-cluster LIFs per node
|4
|Inter-cluster LIFs per cluster
|8
