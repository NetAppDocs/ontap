[.lead]
When preparing to use SnapMirror active sync, be aware of the following object limits. 

== Consistency groups in a cluster

Consistency group limits for a cluster with SnapMirror active sync are calculated based on relationships and depend on the version of ONTAP used. Limits are platform-independent. 

[options="header"]
|===
| ONTAP version | Maximum number of relationships
| ONTAP 9.11.1 and later | 50*
| ONTAP 9.10.1 | 20
| ONTAP 9.9.1 | 5
|===

{asterisk} Beginning with ONTAP 9.16.1, SnapMirror active sync supports four-node clusters in symmetric active/active configurations. In a four-node cluster, 100 consistency groups are supported. 

== Volumes per consistency group

The maximum number of volumes per consistency group with SnapMirror active sync is platform independent. 

[options="header"]
|===
| ONTAP version | Maximum number of volumes supported in a consistency group relationship
| ONTAP 9.15.1 and later | 80 
| ONTAP 9.10.1-9.14.1 | 16 
| ONTAP 9.9.1 | 12 
|===

== Volumes

Volume limits in SnapMirror active sync are calculated based on the number of endpoints, not the number of relationships. A consistency group with 12 volumes contributes 12 endpoints on both the primary and secondary cluster. Both SnapMirror active sync and SnapMirror synchronous relationships contribute to the total number of endpoints.

[IMPORTANT]
These limits apply to FAS, AFF, and current ASA systems. If you have an ASA r2 system (ASA A1K, ASA A90, ASA A70, ASA A50, ASA A30, ASA A20, or ASA C30), see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/asa-r2/data-protection/manage-consistency-groups.html[ASA r2 documentation^].

The maximum endpoints per platform are included in the following table.

[options="header"]
|===
| S. No |Platform 3+| Endpoints per HA for SnapMirror active sync 3+| Overall sync and SnapMirror active sync endpoints per HA
|
|
| ONTAP 9.11.1 and later | ONTAP 9.10.1 | ONTAP 9.9.1
| ONTAP 9.11.1 and later | ONTAP 9.10.1 | ONTAP 9.9.1
|1 | AFF | 400* | 200 | 60 |400 | 200 | 80
|2 | ASA | 400* | 200 | 60 | 400 | 200 | 80
|===

{asterisk} Beginning with ONTAP 9.16.1, SnapMirror active sync supports four-node clusters in symmetric active/active configurations. The total limit for a four-node cluster is 800 endpoints. 

== SAN object limits

SAN object limits are included in the following table. The limits apply regardless of the platform.

|===
|Object in an SnapMirror active sync relationship |Count

|LUNs per volume
a|* 256 (ONTAP 9.9.1 - ONTAP 9.15.0)
    * 512 (ONTAP 9.15.1 and later)
|Number of unique LUNs per 2 x 2 SnapMirror active sync solution | 4,096
|Number of unique LUNs per 4 x 4 SnapMirror active-sync solution (available beginning with ONTAP 9.16.1) | 6,144
|LIFs per SVM (with at least one volume in an SnapMirror active sync relationship)
|256
|Inter-cluster LIFs per node
|4
|Inter-cluster LIFs per cluster
|8
