[.lead]
You can monitor the following SnapMirror active sync operations to ensure the health of your SnapMirror active sync configuration: 

* ONTAP Mediator 
* Planned failover operations
* Automatic unplanned failover operations 
* SnapMirror active sync availability

[NOTE]
Beginning in ONTAP 9.15.1, System Manager displays the status of your SnapMirror active sync relationship from either cluster. You can also monitor the ONTAP Mediator's status from either cluster in System Manager. 

== ONTAP Mediator

During normal operations, the ONTAP Mediator state should be connected. If it's in any other state, this might indicate an error condition. You can review the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-ems-9131/sm-mediator-events.html[Event Management System (EMS) messages^] to determine the error and appropriate corrective actions.

== Planned failover operations

You can monitor status and progress of a planned failover operation using the `snapmirror failover show` command. For example:

....
ClusterB::> snapmirror failover start -destination-path vs1:/cg/dcg1
....

Once the failover operation is complete, you can monitor the SnapMirror protection status from the new destination cluster. For example:

....
ClusterA::> snapmirror show
....

Refer to the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-ems-9131/smbc-pfo-events.html[EMS reference^] to learn about event messages and corrective actions. 

== Automatic unplanned failover operations

During an unplanned automatic failover, you can monitor the status of the operation using the `snapmirror failover show` command.

....
ClusterB::> snapmirror failover show -instance

         Source Path: vs1:/cg/scg3

Refer to the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-ems-9131/smbc-aufo-events.html[EMS reference^] to learn about event messages and about corrective actions. 

== SnapMirror active sync availability

You can check the availability of the SnapMirror active sync relationship using a series of commands, either on the primary cluster, the secondary cluster, or both.

Commands you use include the `snapmirror mediator show` command on both the primary and secondary cluster to check the connection and quorum status, the `snapmirror show` command, and the `volume show` command. For example:

....
SMBC_A::*> snapmirror mediator show
Mediator Address Peer Cluster     Connection Status Quorum Status

10.236.172.86    SMBC_B           connected         true
