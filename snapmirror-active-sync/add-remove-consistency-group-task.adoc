[.lead]
As your application workload requirements change, you may need to add or remove volumes from a consistency group to ensure business continuity. The process of adding and removing volumes in an an active SnapMirror active sync relationship depends on the version of ONTAP you are using.

In most instances, this is a disruptive process requiring you to delete the SnapMirror relationship, modify the consistency group, then resume protection. Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, adding volumes to a consistency group with an active SnapMirror relationship is a non-disruptive operation.

.About this task
* In ONTAP 9.9.1, you can add or remove volumes to a consistency group using the ONTAP CLI. 
* Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, it is recommended that you manage link:../consistency-groups/index.html[consistency groups] through System Manager or with the ONTAP REST API.
+
If you want to change the composition of the consistency group by adding or removing a volume, you must first delete the original relationship and then create the consistency group again with the new composition.
* Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, you can non-disruptively add volumes to a consistency group with an active SnapMirror relationship from the source or destination.
+
Removing volumes is a disruptive operation. You must delete the SnapMirror relationship before removing volumes.

.Before you begin

* You cannot begin to modify the consistency group while it is in the `InSync` state.
* The destination volume should be of type DP.
* The new volume you add to expand the consistency group must have a pair of common snapshots between the source and destination volumes.

.Steps

The examples shown in two volume mappings: `vol_src1` <--> `vol_dst1` and `vol_src2` <--> `vol_dst2`, in a consistency group relationship between the end points `vs1_src:/cg/cg_src` and `vs1_dst:/cg/cg_dst`.

. On the source and destination clusters, verify there is a common snapshot between the source and destination clusters with the command `snapshot show -vserver _svm_name_ -volume _volume_name_ -snapshot _snapmirror_`
+
`source::>snapshot show -vserver vs1_src -volume vol_src3 -snapshot snapmirror*`
+
`destination::>snapshot show -vserver vs1_dst -volume vol_dst3 -snapshot snapmirror*`

. If no common snapshot exists, create and initialize a FlexVol SnapMirror relationship:
+
`destination::>snapmirror initialize -source-path vs1_src:vol_src3 -destination-path vs1_dst:vol_dst3`

. Delete the consistency group relationship:
+
`destination::>snapmirror delete -destination-path vs1_dst:/cg/cg_dst`

. Release the source SnapMirror relationship and retain the common snapshots:
+
`source::>snapmirror release -relationship-info-only true -destination-path vs1_dst:vol_dst3`

. Unmap the LUNs and delete the existing consistency group relationship:
+
`destination::>lun mapping delete -vserver vs1_dst -path <lun_path> -igroup <igroup_name>`
+
NOTE: The destination LUNs are unmapped, while the LUNs on the primary copy continue to serve the host I/O.
+
`destination::>snapmirror delete -destination-path vs1_dst:/cg/cg_dst`
+
`source::>snapmirror release -destination-path vs1_dst:/cg/cg_dst -relationship-info-only true`

. **If you are using ONTAP 9.10.1 through 9.13.0,** delete and recreate and the consistency group on the source with the correct composition. Follow the steps in xref:../consistency-groups/delete-task.html[Delete a consistency group] and then xref:../consistency-groups/configure-task.html[Configure a single consistency group]. In ONTAP 9.10.1 and later, you must perform the delete and create operations in System Manager or with the ONTAP REST API; there is no CLI procedure.
+
**If you are using ONTAP 9.9.1, skip to the next step.**

. Create the new consistency group on the destination with the new composition:
+
`destination::>snapmirror create -source-path vs1_src:/cg/cg_src -destination-path vs1_dst:/cg/cg_dst -cg-item-mappings vol_src1:@vol_dst1, vol_src2:@vol_dst2, vol_src3:@vol_dst3`

. Resynchronize the zero RTO consistency group relationship to ensure it is in sync:
+
`destination::>snapmirror resync -destination-path vs1_dst:/cg/cg_dst`

. Remap the LUNs that you unmapped in Step 5:
+
`destination::> lun map -vserver vs1_dst -path _lun_path_ -igroup _igroup_name_`

. Rescan host LUN I/O paths to restore all paths to the LUNs.

.ONTAP 9.13.1 and later
--
Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, you can non-disruptively add volumes to a consistency group with an active SnapMirror active sync relationship. SnapMirror active sync supports adding volumes from both the source or destination. 

include::../_include/snapmirror-active-sync-name.adoc[]

For details on adding volumes from the source consistency group, see xref:../consistency-groups/modify-task.html[Modify a consistency group].

.Add a volume from the destination cluster
. On the destination cluster, select **Protection** > **Relationships**. 
. Find the SnapMirror configuration you want to add volumes to. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon] then **Expand**. 
. Select the volume relationships whose volumes are to be added to consistency group
. Select **Expand**.
