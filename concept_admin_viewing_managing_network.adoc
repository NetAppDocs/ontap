The new network visualization feature enables users to see the network connections path across hosts, ports, SVMs, volumes, etc. in a graphical interface.

The graphic displays when you select *Network > Overview* or when you select image:icon_arrow.gif[the blue arrow] from the *Network* section of the Dashboard.

The following categories of components are shown in the graphic:

* Hosts
* Storage ports
* Network interfaces
* Storage VMs
* Data access components

Each section shows additional details that you can hover your mouse over or select to perform network management and configuration tasks.

== Examples
The following are some examples of the many ways you can interact with the graphic to view details about each component or initiate actions to manage your network:

* Click on a host to see its configuration:  the ports, network interfaces, storage VMs, and data access components associated with it.
* Hover the mouse over the number of volumes in a storage VM to select a volume to view its details.
* Select an iSCSI interface to view its performance over the last week.
* Click on image:icon_kabob.gif[the vertical three dots] next to a component to initiate actions to modify that component.
* Quickly determine where problems might occur in your network, indicated by an "X" next to unhealthy components.
