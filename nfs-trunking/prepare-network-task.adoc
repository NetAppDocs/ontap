To take advantage of NFSv4.1 trunking, the LIFs in a trunking group must reside on the same node and have home ports on the same node. The LIFs should be configured in a failover group on the same node.

.About this task

A one-to-one mapping of LIFs and NICs yields the greatest performance gain but is not required to enable trunking. Having at least two NICs installed can offer a performance benefit, but it is not required. 

You can have multiple failover groups, but the failover group for trunking should include only those LIFS in the trunking group. 

You should adjust the trunking failover group any time you add or remove connections (and underlying NICs) from a failover group.

.Before you begin

* You should know the port names associated with the NICs if you want to create a failover group.
* The ports must all be on the same node.

.Steps

. Verify the names and status of the network ports you plan to use:
+
`network port status`
. Create the failover group:
+
`network interface failover-groups create -vserver _svm_name_ -failover-group _failover_group_name_ -targets _ports_list_`
+
[NOTE]
It is not a requirement to have a failover group, but it is strongly recommended. 
+
* `_svm_name_` is the name of the SVM containing the NFS server.
+
* `_ports_list_` is the list of ports that will be added to the failover group.
+
Ports are added in the format _node_name:port_number_, for example, node1:e0c.
+
The following command creates failover group fg3 for SVM vs1 and adds three ports:
+
`network interface failover-groups create -vserver vs1 -failover-group fg3 -targets cluster1-01:e0c,cluster1-01:e0d,cluster1-01:e0e`
+
Learn more about link:../networking/configure_failover_groups_and_policies_for_lifs_overview.html[failover groups.]

. If needed, create LIFs for members of the trunking group:
+
`network interface create -vserver _svm_name_ -lif _lif_name_ -home-node _node_name_ -home-port _port_name_ -address _IP_address_ -netmask _IP_address_ [-service-policy _policy_] [-auto-revert {true|false}]`
+
* `-home-node` - the node to which the LIF returns when the network interface revert command is run on the LIF.
+
You can also specify whether the LIF should automatically revert to the home-node and home-port with the `-auto-revert` option.
+
* `-home-port` is the physical or logical port to which the LIF returns when the network interface revert command is run on the LIF.
+
* You can specify an IP address with the `-address` and `-netmask` options, not with the `-subnet` option.
+
* When you assign IP addresses, you may need to configure a default route to a gateway if there are clients or domain controllers on a different IP subnet. The `network route create` man page contains information about creating a static route within an SVM.
+
* `-service-policy` - the service policy for the LIF. If no policy is specified, a default policy will be assigned automatically. Use the `network interface service-policy show` command to review available service policies.
+ 
* `-auto-revert` - specify whether a data LIF is automatically reverted to its home node under circumstances such as startup, changes to the status of the management database, or when the network connection is made. The default setting is false, but you can set it to true depending on network management policies in your environment.
+
Repeat this step for every LIF in the trunking group.
+
The following command creates `lif-A` for the SVM `vs1`, on port `e0c` of the node `cluster1_01`:
+
`network interface create -vserver vs1 -lif lif-A -service-policy *???* -home-node cluster1_01 -home-port e0c -address 192.0.2.0`
+

. Verify the LIFs were created:
+
`network interface show`

. Verify the configured IP address is reachable:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="25,75"]
