To take advantage of NFSv4.1 trunking, the LIFs in a trunking group must reside on the same node and have home ports on the same node. The LIFs should be configured in a failover group on the same node.

include::../_include/nfs_trunking_network_intro.adoc[]

.Steps

. Verify the names and status of the network ports you plan to use:
+
`network port show`
. Create a trunking failover group or modify an existing one for trunking:
+
`network interface failover-groups create -vserver _svm_name_ -failover-group _failover_group_name_ -targets _ports_list_`
+
`network interface failover-groups modify -vserver _svm_name_ -failover-group _failover_group_name_ -targets _ports_list_`
+
[NOTE]
It is not a requirement to have a failover group, but it is strongly recommended. 
+
* `_svm_name_` is the name of the SVM containing the NFS server.
+
* `_ports_list_` is the list of ports that will be added to the failover group.
+
Ports are added in the format `_node_name:port_number_`, for example, `node1:e0c`.
+
The following command creates failover group `fg3` for SVM vs1 and adds three ports:
+
`network interface failover-groups create -vserver vs1 -failover-group fg3 -targets cluster1-01:e0c,cluster1-01:e0d,cluster1-01:e0e`
+
Learn more about link:../networking/configure_failover_groups_and_policies_for_lifs_overview.html[failover groups.]

. Create additional LIFs for members of the trunking group as needed:
+
`network interface create -vserver _svm_name_ -lif _lif_name_ -home-node _node_name_ -home-port _port_name_ -address _IP_address_ -netmask _IP_address_ [-service-policy _policy_] [-auto-revert {true|false}]`
+
* `-home-node` - the node to which the LIF returns when the network interface revert command is run on the LIF.
+
You can specify whether the LIF should automatically revert to the home-node and home-port with the `-auto-revert` option.
+
* `-home-port` is the physical or logical port to which the LIF returns when the network interface revert command is run on the LIF.
+
* You can specify an IP address with the `-address` and `-netmask` options.
+
* When you assign IP addresses manually (without using a subnet), you might need to configure a default route to a gateway if there are clients or domain controllers on a different IP subnet. The network route create man page contains information about creating a static route within an SVM.
+
* `-service-policy` - the service policy for the LIF. If no policy is specified, a default policy will be assigned automatically. Use the `network interface service-policy show` command to review available service policies.
+
* `-auto-revert` - specify whether a data LIF is automatically reverted to its home node under circumstances such as startup, changes to the status of the management database, or when the network connection is made. *The default setting is false*, but you can set it to true depending on network management policies in your environment.
+
Repeat this step for each additional LIF needed in the trunking group.
+
The following command creates lif-A for the SVM vs1, on port e0c of the node cluster1_01:
+
`network interface create -vserver vs1 -lif lif-A -service-policy default-intercluster -home-node cluster1_01 -home-port e0c -address 192.0.2.0`
+

. Verify that the LIFs were created:
+
`network interface show`

. Verify that the configured IP address is reachable:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="25,75"]
