To take advantage of NFSv4.1 trunking, the LIFs in a trunking group must reside on the same node and have home ports on the same node. The LIFs should be configured in a failover group on the same node.

include::../_include/nfs_trunking_network_intro.adoc[]

.Steps

. Verify the names and status of the network ports you plan to use:
+
`network port show`
. Create a trunking failover group or modify an existing one for trunking:
+
`network interface failover-groups create -vserver <svm_name> -failover-group <failover_group_name> -targets <ports_list>`
+
`network interface failover-groups modify -vserver <svm_name> -failover-group <failover_group_name> -targets <ports_list>`
+
[NOTE]
It is not a requirement to have a failover group, but it is strongly recommended. 
+
* `<svm_name>` is the name of the SVM containing the NFS server.
+
* `<ports_list>` is the list of ports that will be added to the failover group.
+
Ports are added in the format `<node_name>:<port_number>`, for example, `node1:e0c`.
+
The following command creates failover group `fg3` for SVM vs1 and adds three ports:
+
`network interface failover-groups create -vserver vs1 -failover-group fg3 -targets cluster1-01:e0c,cluster1-01:e0d,cluster1-01:e0e`
+
Learn more about link:../networking/configure_failover_groups_and_policies_for_lifs_overview.html[failover groups.]

. Create additional LIFs for members of the trunking group as needed:
+
`network interface create -vserver <svm_name> -lif <lif_name> -home-node <node_name> -home-port <port_name> -address <IP_address> -netmask <IP_address> [-service-policy <policy>] [-auto-revert <true|false>]`
+
* `-home-node` - the node to which the LIF returns when the network interface revert command is run on the LIF.
+
You can specify whether the LIF should automatically revert to the home-node and home-port with the `-auto-revert` option.
+
* `-home-port` is the physical or logical port to which the LIF returns when the network interface revert command is run on the LIF.
+
* You can specify an IP address with the `-address` and `-netmask` options.
+
* When you assign IP addresses manually (without using a subnet), you might need to configure a default route to a gateway if there are clients or domain controllers on a different IP subnet. The network route create man page contains information about creating a static route within an SVM.
+
* `-service-policy` - the service policy for the LIF. If no policy is specified, a default policy will be assigned automatically. Use the `network interface service-policy show` command to review available service policies.
+
* `-auto-revert` - specify whether a data LIF is automatically reverted to its home node under circumstances such as startup, changes to the status of the management database, or when the network connection is made. *The default setting is false*, but you can set it to true depending on network management policies in your environment.
+
Repeat this step for each additional LIF needed in the trunking group.
+
The following command creates `lif-A` for the SVM `vs1`, on port `e0c` of the node `cluster1_01`:
+
`network interface create -vserver vs1 -lif lif-A -service-policy default-intercluster -home-node cluster1_01 -home-port e0c -address 192.0.2.0`
+

. Verify that the LIFs were created:
+
[source,cli]
----
network interface show

. Verify that the configured IP address is reachable:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="25,75"]
