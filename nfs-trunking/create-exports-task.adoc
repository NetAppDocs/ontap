= Create an ONTAP volume export policy

[.lead]
To provide client access to data shares, you must create one or more volumes, and the volume must have export policies with at least one rule.  

Client export requirements:

* Linux clients must have a separate mount and a separate mount point for each trunking connection (that is, for each LIF).
* VMware clients require only a single mount point for an exported volume, with multiple LIFs specified. 
+
VMware clients require root access in the export policy.

.Steps

. Create an export policy:
+
`vserver export-policy create -vserver _svm_name_ -policyname _policy_name_`
+
The policy name can be up to 256 characters long.
. Verify that the export policy was created:
+
`vserver export-policy show -policyname _policy_name_`
+
.Example
+
The following commands create and verify the creation of an export policy named exp1 on the SVM named vs1:
+
`vs1::> vserver export-policy create -vserver vs1 -policyname exp1`
. Create an export rule and add it to an existing export policy:
+
`vserver export-policy rule create -vserver _svm_name_ -policyname _policy_name_ -ruleindex _integer_ -protocol nfs4 -clientmatch { _text | "text,text,â€¦"_ } -rorule _security_type_ -rwrule _security_type_ -superuser _security_type_ -anon _user_ID_`
+
The `-clientmatch` parameter should identify the trunking-capable Linux or VMware clients that will mount the export.

. Create the volume with a junction point:
+
`volume create -vserver _svm_name_ -volume _volume_name_ -aggregate _aggregate_name_-size {integer[KB|MB|GB|TB|PB]} -security-style unix -user _user_name_or_number_ -group _group_name_or_number_ -junction-path _junction_path_ -policy _export_policy_name_`
+

. Verify that the volume was created with the desired junction point:
+
`volume show -vserver _svm_name_ -volume _volume_name_ -junction-path`
