Trunking must be explicitly enabled on NFS servers. NFSv4.1 is enabled by default when NFS servers are created.

After enabling trunking, verify that the following services are configured as needed.

* link:../nfs-config/configure-dns-host-name-resolution-task.html[DNS]
* link:../nfs-config/using-ldap-concept.html[LDAP]
* link:../nfs-config/kerberos-nfs-strong-security-concept.html[Kerberos]

.Steps 

. Enable trunking and ensure that NFSv4.1 is enabled:
+
`vserver nfs create -vserver _svm_name_ -v4.1 enabled -v4.1-trunking enabled`
. Verify that NFS is running:
`vserver nfs status -vserver _svm_name_`
. Verify that NFS is configured as desired:
+
`vserver nfs show -vserver _svm_name_`
+

.. If you are serving to Windows clients from this SVM, move the shares then delete the server.
`vserver cifs show -vserver _svm_name_`
+
`vserver cifs delete -vserver _svm_name_`
