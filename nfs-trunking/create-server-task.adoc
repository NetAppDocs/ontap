= Create a trunking-enabled NFS server on an ONTAP SVM

[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, trunking can be enabled on NFS servers. NFSv4.1 is enabled by default when NFS servers are created.

.Before you begin 

Creating a trunking-enabled NFS server requires an SVM. The SVM must be:

* backed by sufficient storage for client data requirements. 
* enabled for NFS.

You can use an existing SVM; however enabling trunking requires all NFSv4.x clients to be remounted, which can be disruptive. If remounting is not possible, create a new SVM for the NFS server.  

.Steps

. If a suitable SVM does not exist, create one:
+
`vserver create -vserver _svm_name_ -rootvolume _root_volume_name_ -aggregate _aggregate_name_ -rootvolume-security-style unix -language C.UTF-8`
. Verify the configuration and status of the newly created SVM:
+
`vserver show -vserver _svm_name_`
+
Learn more about link:../nfs-config/create-svms-data-access-task.html[creating an SVM].
. Create the NFS server:
+
`vserver nfs create -vserver _svm_name_ -v3 disabled -v4.0 disabled -v4.1 enabled -v4.1-trunking enabled -v4-id-domain _my_domain.com_`
. Verify that NFS is running:
+
`vserver nfs status -vserver _svm_name_`
. Verify that NFS is configured as desired:
+
`vserver nfs show -vserver _svm_name_`
+
