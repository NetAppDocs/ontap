[.lead]
You can adapt an existing single-path (non-trunked) NFSv4.1 export to use trunking. Trunking-capable clients can take advantage of improved performance as soon as trunking is enabled on the server, provided the server and client prerequisites have been satisfied.

Adapting a single-path export for trunking allows you to maintain exported data sets in their existing volumes and SVMs. To do so, you must enable trunking on the NFS server, update networking and export configuration, and remount the exported share on the clients. 

Enabling trunking has the effect of restarting the server. VMware clients must then remount the exported datastores; Linux clients must remount exported volumes with the `max_connect` option.
