Linux and VMware clients that support trunking can mount volumes or data shares from an ONTAP NFSv4.1 server that is enabled for trunking.

When entering mount commands on the clients, you must enter IP addresses for each LIF in the trunking group.

.Linux client requirements
--
A separate mount point is required for each connection in the trunking group.

Mount the exported volumes with commands similar to the following:

`mount lif1_ip:/vol-test /mnt/test1 -o vers=4.1,max_connect=16`

`mount lif2_ip:/vol-test /mnt/test2 -o vers=4.1,max_connect=16`

The version (`vers`) value should be `4.1` or later.

The `max_connect` value corresponds to the number of connections in the trunking group.

.VMware client requirements
-- 
A mount statement is required that includes an IP address for each connection in the trunking group.

Mount the exported datastore with a command similar to the following:

`#esxcli storage nfs41 -H lif1_ip, lif2_ip -s /mnt/sh are1 -v nfs41share`

The `-H` values correspond to the connections in the trunking group.
