= Terminate certain SMB sessions before reverting ONTAP
:icons: font

[.lead]

Before you revert an ONTAP cluster from any version of ONTAP 9, you should identify and gracefully terminate any SMB sessions that are not continuously available.

Continuously available SMB shares, which are accessed by Hyper-V or Microsoft SQL Server clients using the SMB 3.0 protocol, do not need to be terminated before upgrading or downgrading.

.Steps

. Identify any established SMB sessions that are not continuously available:
+
[source, cli]
----
vserver cifs session show -continuously-available No -instance
----
+
This command displays detailed information about any SMB sessions that have no continuous availability. You should terminate them before proceeding with the ONTAP downgrade.
+
----
cluster1::> vserver cifs session show -continuously-available No -instance
