[.lead]
If you have enabled trunking for client connections, you must disable trunking on any NFSv4.1 servers before reverting from ONTAP 9.14.1.

When you enter the `revert-to` command, you will see a warning message advising you to disable trunking before proceeding.

After reverting to an ONTAP 9.13.1, the clients using trunked connections fall back to using a single connection. Their data throughput will be affected, but there will be no disruption. The revert behavior is the same as modifying the NFSv4.1 trunking option for the SVM from enabled to disabled.

.Steps

. Disable trunking on the NFSv4.1 server:
+
[source,cli]
----
vserver nfs modify -vserver _svm_name_ -v4.1-trunking disabled
----

. Verify that NFS is configured as desired:
+
[source,cli]
----
vserver nfs show -vserver _svm_name_
