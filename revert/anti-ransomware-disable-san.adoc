= Disable Autonomous Ransomware Protection on SAN volumes before reverting from ONTAP 9.17.1

[.lead]
The ONTAP ARP feature for SAN volumes is not supported in ONTAP 9.16.1 and earlier. It's recommended that you disable ARP on SAN volumes before reverting to ONTAP 9.16.1 or earlier to prevent the feature from staying active and using CPU and disk resources without performing any actual detection on the reverted version.
