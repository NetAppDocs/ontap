If you enabled anti-ransomware protection for a SAN volume and you revert from ONTAP 9.17.1 or later to ONTAP 9.16.1 or earlier, you might use CPU and disk space unnecessarily. ONTAP ARP feature for SAN volumes is not supported in ONTAP 9.16.1 and earlier but could continue to run and consume resources.
