Before you revert an ONTAP cluster, you should confirm hardware support and review resources to understand issues you might encounter or need to resolve.

. Review the link:https://library.netapp.com/ecmdocs/ECMLP2492508/html/frameset.html[ONTAP 9 Release Notes] for the target release.
+
The "`Important cautions`" section describes potential issues that you should be aware of before downgrading or reverting.

. Confirm that your hardware platform is supported in the target release.

. Confirm that your cluster and management switches are supported in the target release.
+
You must verify that the NX-OS (cluster network switches), IOS (management network switches), and reference configuration file (RCF) software versions are compatible with the version of ONTAP to which you are reverting.
