Before you revert your current ONTAP software, you must download the target software version from the NetApp Support site and then install it.

== Download the ONTAP software image

Software images are specific to platform models. You must obtain the correct image for your cluster. Software images, firmware version information, and the latest firmware for your platform model are available on the NetApp Support Site.  Software images include the latest version of system firmware that was available when a given version of ONTAP was released.

NOTE: If you are reverting a system with NetApp Volume Encryption from ONTAP 9.5 or later, you must download the ONTAP software image for non-restricted countries, which includes NetApp Volume Encryption.  If you use the ONTAP software image for restricted countries to revert a system with NetApp Volume Encryption, the system panics and you lose access to your volumes.

.Steps

. Locate the target ONTAP software in the link:http://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/software[Software Downloads^] area of the NetApp Support Site.

. Copy the software image (for example, 97_q_image.tgz) from the NetApp Support Site
+
You can copy the image to the directory on the HTTP server or FTP server from which the image will be served or to a local folder.

== Install the ONTAP software image

After downloading the target ONTAP software image from the NetApp support site, install it on the cluster nodes.

.Steps

. Set the privilege level to advanced: 
+
[source,cli]
----
set -privilege advanced
----
+
The advanced prompt (`*>`) appears.

. Enter `y` to continue when prompted .

. Install the software image:
+
* For standard configurations or a two-node MetroCluster configuration enter the following command:
+
[source,cli]
----
system node image update -node * -package location -replace-package true -setdefault true -background true
----
+
This command downloads and installs the software image on all of the nodes simultaneously. To download and install the image on each node one at a time, do not specify the `-background` parameter.  This command also uses an extended query to change the target software image, which is installed as the alternate image, to be the default image for the node.

* For a four-node or eight-node MetroCluster configuration, enter the following command on both clusters:
+
[source,cli]
----
system node image update -node * -package location -replace-package true true -background true -setdefault false
----
+
This command downloads and installs the software image on all of the nodes simultaneously. To download and install the image on each node one at a time, do not specify the `-background` parameter. This command also uses an extended query to change the target software image, which is installed as the alternate image on each node.

. Enter `y` to continue when prompted.

. Verify that the software image is downloaded and installed on each node: 
+
[source,cli]
----
system node image show-update-progress -node *
----
+
This command displays the current status of the software image download and installation. You should continue to run this command until all nodes report a *Run Status* of "Exited,"" and an *Exit Status* of "Success."
+
The system node image update command can fail and display error or warning messages. After resolving any errors or warnings, you can run the command again.
+
This example shows a two-node cluster in which the software image is downloaded and installed successfully on both nodes:
+
----
cluster1::*> system node image show-update-progress -node *
There is no update/install in progress

        Run Status:     Exited
        Exit Status:    Success
        Phase:          Run Script
        Exit Message:   After a clean shutdown, image2 will be set as the default boot image on node0.
