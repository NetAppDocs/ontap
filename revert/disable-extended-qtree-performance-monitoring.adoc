[.lead]

Beginning with ONTAP 9.16.1, you can use the ONTAP REST API to access the extended qtree monitoring capabilities which includes latency metrics and historical statistics.If extended qtree monitoring is enabled on any qtrees, before you revert from 9.16.1, you must set `ext_performance_monitoring.enabled` to false.
