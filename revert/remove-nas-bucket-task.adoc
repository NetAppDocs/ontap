[.lead]
If you have configured S3 client access for NAS data, before you revert from ONTAP 9.12.1 or later to ONTAP 9.11.1 or earlier, you should use the ONTAP command line interface (CLI) to remove the NAS bucket configuration and to remove any name mappings (S3 users to Windows or Unix users).

.About this task
The following tasks are completed in the background during the revert process.

* Remove all partially completed singleton object creations (that is, all entries in hidden directories).
* Remove all hidden directories; there might be one on for each volume that is accessible from the root of the export mapped from the S3 NAS bucket.
* Remove the upload table.
* Delete any default-unix-user and default-windows-user values for all configured S3 servers.
