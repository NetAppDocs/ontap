[.lead]
In ONTAP 9.9.1 and later the the `-role` parameter for user accounts is changed to `admin`.  If you created user accounts on ONTAP 9.8 or earlier, upgraded to ONTAP 9.9.1 or later and then reverted back to ONTAP 9.8, the `-role` parameter is restored to its original value. You should verify that the modified values are acceptable.

During revert, if the role for an SP user has been deleted, the "rbac.spuser.role.notfound" EMS message will be logged.

For more information, see link:../system-admin/accounts-access-sp-concept.html[Accounts that can access the SP].
