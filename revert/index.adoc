To transition a cluster to an earlier ONTAP release, you must perform a reversion.

The information in this section will guide you through the steps you should take before and after you revert, including the resources you should read and the necessary pre- and post-revert checks you should perform.

NOTE: If you need to transition a cluster from ONTAP 9.1 to ONTAP 9.0, you need to use the downgrade procedure documented link:https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2876873[here].
