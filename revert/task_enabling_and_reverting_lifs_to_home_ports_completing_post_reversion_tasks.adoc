= Enable and revert LIFs to home ports after an ONTAP revert

[.lead]
During a reboot, some LIFs might have been migrated to their assigned failover ports. After you revert an ONTAP cluster, you must enable and revert any LIFs that are not on their home ports.

The network interface revert command reverts a LIF that is not currently on its home port back to its home port, provided that the home port is operational. A LIF's home port is specified when the LIF is created; you can determine the home port for a LIF by using the network interface show command.

.Steps

. Display the status of all LIFs: 
+
[source,cli]
----
network interface show
----
+
This example displays the status of all LIFs for a storage virtual machine (SVM).

If any LIFs appear with a Status Admin status of down or with an Is home status of false, continue with the next step.

. Enable the data LIFs: 
+
[source,cli]
----
network interface modify {-role data} -status-admin up
----

. Revert LIFs to their home ports: 
+
[source,cli]
----
network interface revert *
----

. Verify that all LIFs are in their home ports:
+
[source,cli]
----
network interface show
----
+
This example shows that all LIFs for SVM vs0 are on their home ports.
