= Do I need technical support to revert an ONTAP cluster?

:icons: font

[.lead]

You should contact technical support before you attempt to revert an ONTAP cluster in the following situations:

* A production environment
+
Do not attempt to revert a production cluster without assistance from technical support. 

* You created volumes in ONTAP 9.5 or later and you need to revert to an earlier version.
+
Volumes using adaptive compression must be uncompressed before reverting.

You can revert new or test clusters without assistance. If you attempt to revert a cluster on your own and experience any of the following issues, you should call technical support:

* The revert fails or cannot finish.
* The revert finishes, but the cluster is unusable in a production environment.
* The revert finishes and the cluster goes into production, but you are not satisfied with its behavior.
