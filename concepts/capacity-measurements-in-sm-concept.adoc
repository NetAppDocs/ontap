System capacity can be measured as physical space or logical space. Recent versions of System Manager use measurements of both physical and logical capacity.

The differences between the two measurements are explained in the following descriptions:

* *Physical capacity*:  Physical space refers to the physical blocks of storage used in the volume or local tier. The value for physical used capacity is typically smaller than the value for logical used capacity due to the reduction of data from storage efficiency features (such as deduplication and compression).

* *Logical capacity*: Logical space refers to the usable space (the logical blocks) in a volume or local tier. Logical space refers to how theoretical space can be used, without accounting for results of deduplication or compression.  The value for logical space used is derived from the amount of physical space used plus the savings from storage efficiency features (such as deduplication and compression) that have been configured.  This measurement often appears larger than the physical used capacity because it includes Snapshot copies, clones, and other components, and it does not reflect the data compression and other reductions in the physical space. Thus, the total logical capacity could be higher than the provisioned space.

NOTE: In System Manager, capacity representations do not account for root storage tier (aggregate) capacities.

.Additional information

You can monitor the capacity of a cluster, local tiers, storage VMs, and volumes in System Manager.  Refer to link:../task_admin_monitor_capacity_in_sm.html[Monitor capacity in System Manager].

== Measurements of used capacity

Measurements of used capacity are displayed differently depending on the version of System Manager you are using, as explained in the following table:

a|9.7 and 9.8
a|Used

[[cap-measurement-terms]]

== Capacity measurement terms
The following terms are used when describing capacity:


* *Allocated capacity*:  The amount of space that has been allocated for volumes in a storage VM.
* *Available*: The amount of physical space available to store data or to provision volumes in a storage VM or on a local tier.
* *Capacity across volumes*: The sum of the used storage and available storage of all the volumes on a storage VM.
* *Client data*:  The amount of space used by client data (either physical or logical).
* *Committed*: The amount of committed capacity for a local tier.
* *Data reduction*: 
** *Overall*: The ratio of all logical used space compared to physical used space.
** *Without Snapshot copies and clones*: The ratio of logical space used only by client data compared to physical space used only by client data.
* *Logical used*: The amount of used space without considering the space saved by storage efficiency features.
* *Logical used %*: The percentage of the current logical used capacity compared to the provisioned size, excluding Snapshot reserves.  This value can be greater than 100%, because it includes efficiency savings in the volume.
* *Maximum capacity*: The maximum amount of space allocated for volumes on a storage VM.
* *Physical used*: The amount of capacity used in the physical blocks of a volume or local tier.
* *Physical used %*: The percentage of capacity used in the physical blocks of a volume compared to the provisioned size.
* *Reserved*: The amount of space reserved for already provisioned volumes in a local tier.
* *Used*: The amount of space that contains data.
* *Used and reserved*: The sum of physical used and reserved space.

[[cap-x-vols-max-cap]]
== Capacity across volumes and maximum capacity

Beginning with 9.13.1, you can link:../task_admin_monitor_capacity_in_sm.html#enable-max-cap[enable the maximum capacity limit of a storage VM]. An explanation of how the measurement of the capacity across volumes relates to the maximum capacity limit is shown in the following chart.

image:max-cap-limit-cap-x-volumes.gif[graphic that shows maximum capacity limit comprised of allocated space and available space and that the capacity across volumes occupies only the allocated space.]

[[cap-measurement-units]]

== Capacity measurement units
System Manager calculates storage capacity based on binary units of 1024 (2^10^) bytes.  In ONTAP 9.10.0 and earlier, these units were displayed in System Manager as KB, MB, GB, TB, and PB.  Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, they are displayed in System Manager as KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, and PiB.

NOTE:  The units used in System Manager for throughput continue to be KB/s, MB/s, GB/s, TB/s, and PB/s for all releases of ONTAP.
