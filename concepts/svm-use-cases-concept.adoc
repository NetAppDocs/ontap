summary: "Service providers use SVMs in secure multitenancy arrangements to isolate each tenant’s data, to provide each tenant with its own authentication and administration, and to simplify chargeback. You can assign multiple LIFs to the same SVM to satisfy different customer needs, and you can use QoS to protect against tenant workloads “bullying” the workloads of other tenants."

Service providers use SVMs in secure multitenancy arrangements to isolate each tenant's data, to provide each tenant with its own authentication and administration, and to simplify chargeback. You can assign multiple LIFs to the same SVM to satisfy different customer needs, and you can use QoS to protect against tenant workloads "`bullying`" the workloads of other tenants.

Administrators use SVMs for similar purposes in the enterprise. You might want to segregate data from different departments, or keep storage volumes accessed by hosts in one SVM and user share volumes in another. Some administrators put iSCSI/FC LUNs and NFS datastores in one SVM and SMB shares in another.
