ONTAP's Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) offerings support latency-sensitive and high-bandwidth workloads. RDMA allows data to be copied directly between storage system memory and host system memory, circumventing CPU interruptions and overhead. 

== NFS over RDMA

Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can configure link:../nfs-rdma/index.html[NFS over RDMA] to enable the use of NVIDIA GPUDirect Storage for GPU-accelerated workloads on hosts with supported NVIDIA GPUs.

NOTE: RDMA is not supported with the SMB protocol.

== Cluster interconnect RDMA

Cluster interconnect RDMA reduces latency, decreases failover times, and accelerates communication between nodes in a cluster.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, cluster interconnect RDMA is supported for certain hardware systems when used with X1151A cluster NICs. Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, X91153A NICs also support cluster interconnect RDMA. Consult the table to learn what systems are supported in different ONTAP releases.

Given the appropriate storage system set up, no additional configuration is needed to use cluster interconnect RDMA.
