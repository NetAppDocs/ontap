[.lead]
If you have latency sensitive or high-bandwidth workloads, you may want to take advantage of ONTAP's Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) offerings. RDMA allows data to be copied directly between storage system memory and host system memory, circumventing CPU interruptions and overhead. 

== NFS over RDMA

Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can configure link:../nfs-rdma/index.html[NFS over RDMA] to enable the use of NVIDIA GPUDirect Storage for GPU-accelerated workloads on hosts with supported NVIDIA GPUs.

== RDMA cluster interconnect

Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, ONTAP supports RDMA cluster interconnect for ONTAP users with an A400 or ASA400 storage system with Pensando cluster NICs. RDMA cluster interconnect reduces latency, decreases failover times, and accelerates communication between nodes in a cluster. Given the appropriate storage system set up, no additional configuration is needed.
