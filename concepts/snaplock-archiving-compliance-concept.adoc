[.lead]
_SnapLock_ is a high-performance compliance solution for organizations that use _write once, read many (WORM)_ storage to retain critical files in unmodified form for regulatory and governance purposes.

A single license entitles you to use SnapLock in strict _Compliance mode,_ to satisfy external mandates like SEC Rule 17a-4, and a looser _Enterprise mode,_ to meet internally mandated regulations for the protection of digital assets. SnapLock uses a tamper-proof _ComplianceClock_ to determine when the retention period for a WORM file has elapsed.

You can use _SnapLock for SnapVault_ to WORM-protect Snapshot copies on secondary storage. You can use SnapMirror to replicate WORM files to another geographic location for disaster recovery and other purposes.
