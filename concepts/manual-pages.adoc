For each major ONTAP release, the commonly available CLI commands (ONTAP manual pages, or man pages) are bundled into a _command reference_. These command references explain how to use the CLI commands in each ONTAP release. Man pages are also available at the ONTAP command line with the `man` command. Learn more about the commands described in this procedure in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/[ONTAP command reference^].
