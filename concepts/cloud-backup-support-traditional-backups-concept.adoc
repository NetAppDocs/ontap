In addition to SnapMirror and SnapVault data protection relationships, which were disk-to-disk only for ONTAP 9.7 and earlier, there are now several backup solutions that offer a less expensive alternative for long-term data retention.

Numerous third-party data protection applications offer traditional backup for ONTAP-managed data. Veeam, Veritas, and Commvault, among others, all offer integrated backup for ONTAP systems.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, SnapMirror Cloud provides asynchronous replication of Snapshot copies from ONTAP instances to object storage endpoints. SnapMirror Cloud replication requires a licensed application for orchestration and management of data protection workflows. SnapMirror Cloud relationships are supported from ONTAP systems to select on-premises and public cloud object storage targets -- including AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage Platform, or Microsoft Azure Blob Storage -- which provides enhanced efficiency with vendor backup software. Contact your NetApp representative for a list of supported certified applications and object storage vendors.

If you are interested in cloud-native data protection, BlueXP can be used to configure SnapMirror or SnapVault relationships between on-premises volumes and Cloud Volumes ONTAP instances in the public cloud.

BlueXP also provides backups of Cloud Volumes ONTAP instances using a Software as a Service (SaaS) model. Users can back up their Cloud Volumes ONTAP instances to S3 and S3-compliant public cloud object storage using Cloud Backup found on NetApp Cloud Central.
