You can manage ONTAP 9.10.1 and above releases using System Manager in BlueXP. This integration allows you to efficiently oversee your hybrid multicloud infrastructure using a unified control plane, all while retaining the familiar System Manager user interface.

BlueXP enables you to create and administer cloud storage (for example, Cloud Volumes ONTAP), use NetApp data services (for example, Cloud Backup), and control many on-premise and edge storage devices.

BlueXP provides two ways to discover and manage your clusters:

* Direct discovery for management through System Manager (ONTAP 9.12.1 and later)
* Discovery through a Connector

The Connector is software installed in your environment which allows you to access management functions through System Manager and access BlueXP cloud services that provide features such as data replication, backup and recovery, data classification, data tiering, and more.

== BlueXP and ONTAP 9.12.1

Note: If you are using ONTAP 9.12.1, a message appears to prompt you to try out BlueXP.

[NOTE] 
If your system settings have blocked external networks, you will not be able to access BlueXP.  To access System Manager using BlueXP, you must ensure that the address "`cloudmanager.cloud.netapp.com`" can be accessed by your system.  Otherwise, at the prompt, you can choose to use the version of System Manager that is installed with your ONTAP system.

. On the BlueXP login page, select *Log in with your NetApp Support Site Credentials* and enter your credentials.
+
If you've already used BlueXP and have a login using an email and password, then you'll need to continue using that login option instead.
