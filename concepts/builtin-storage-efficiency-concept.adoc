[.lead]
CPU or dedicated offload processor storage efficiency is enabled by default on certain AFF and FAS platforms.  These platforms do not use temperature-sensitive storage efficiency.  Compression begins without waiting for data to become cold and is performed using either the main CPU or a dedicated offload processor. These platforms also use sequential packing of contiguous physical blocks to further improve storage efficiency for compressed data. 

CPU or dedicated offload processor storage efficiency is available on the following platforms and ONTAP versions:

[cols="2", options="header"]
|===
| Platform | ONTAP version
a| 
* AFF A1K
* AFF A90
* AFF A70
* FAS90
* FAS70 
| 9.15.1 or later

a|
* AFF A50
* AFF A30
| 9.16.1 or later
|===


For the following platforms, storage efficiency is enabled automatically and requires no configuration. This applies to all newly created thin-provisioned volumes and existing data, including volumes moved from other platforms.  Deduplication is enabled regardless of the space guarantee setting. Compression and data compaction both require that the space guarantee be set to none. Data thatâ€™s migrated using volume move or SnapMirror technology is converted automatically to 32k inline compression.

* AFF A1K
* AFF A90
* AFF A70
* AFF A50
* AFF A30


For the following platforms, storage efficiency is enabled by default only on existing thin-provisioned volumes that had storage efficiency enabled before upgrading to ONTAP 9.15.1 or later. You can enable storage efficiency on newly created volumes using the CLI or REST API method. Data that is migrated using volume move or SnapMirror technology is converted to 32k inline compression only if compression was enabled on the original platform.

* FAS90
* FAS70
