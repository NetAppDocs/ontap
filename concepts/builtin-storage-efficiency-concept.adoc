Beginning with ONTAP 9.15.1, ONTAP provides storage efficiency and data compaction on AFF A70, AFF A90, AFF A1K, FAS70, and FAS90 platforms. 

Depending on the platform, the following applies when you upgrade:

* Compression is performed using either the main CPU or with a dedicated offload processor. 

* Storage efficiency is enabled by default on all thin-provisioned volumes or just existing volumes. 
+
For an AFF A70, AFF A90, or AFF A1K platform, storage efficiency is enabled automatically and requires no configuration. This applies to all newly created thin-provisioned volumes and existing data, including volumes moved from other platforms to an AFF A70, AFF A90, or AFF A1K platform.
+
Deduplication is enabled regardless of space guarantee setting. Compression and Data Compaction both require that the space guarantee be set to none.
+
For a FAS70 or FAS90 platform, storage efficiency is enabled by default only on existing thin-provisioned volumes that had storage efficiency enabled before upgrading. You can enable storage efficiency on newly created volumes using the CLI or REST API method.
* Data thatâ€™s migrated using volume move or SnapMirror technology is converted automatically to 32k inline compression:
+
For an AFF A70, AFF A90, or AFF A1K platform, data is converted automatically.
+
For a FAS70 or FAS90 platform, data is converted only if compression was enabled on the original platform. 

Temperature-sensitive storage efficiency isn't applied on AFF A70, AFF A90, AFF A1K, FAS70, and FAS90 platforms. Compression isn't based on hot or cold data on these platforms, so compression begins without waiting for data to become cold. 

Storage efficiency on AFF A70, AFF A90, AFF A1K, FAS70, and FAS90 platforms uses sequential packing of contiguous physical blocks to further improve storage efficiency for compressed data. 

For information about upgrading a controller to an AFF A70, AFF A90, AFF A1K, FAS70, or FAS90, see the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-systems-upgrade/choose_controller_upgrade_procedure.html[ONTAP Hardware Upgrade Documentation^].
