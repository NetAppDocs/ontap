You can integrate ONTAP and related NetApp products with VMware vSphere. There are several options available depending on your technology environment and business needs.

[NOTE]
NetApp regularly enhances our support for vSphere and other VMware technologies. You should review the https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2492508[ONTAP Release Notes^] for specific information about your ONTAP release including any known limitations.

== Selected concepts and terminology

As you begin to explore using ONTAP and related NetApp products in a VMware environment, it's helpful to first be familiar with some of the key terminology and concepts.

Logical unit number::
A LUN is a number used to identify a _logical unit_ within a Storage Area Network (SAN). These addressable devices are typically logical disks accessed through the Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) protocol or one of its encapsulated derivatives.

VMware vSphere virtual volume::
A virtual volume (vVol) provides a volume-level abstraction for storage used by a virtual machine. It includes several benefits and provides an alternative to using a traditional LUN. A vVol datastore is typically associated with a single LUN which acts as a container for the vVols. 

Persistent reservations::
Persistent reservations are supported with SCSI-3 and an improvement over the earlier SCSI-2 reservations. They allow multiple client initiators to communicate with a single target while locking out other nodes. The reservations can persist even if the bus is reset for error recovery.

Windows Server Failover Clustering::
Microsoft WSFC is a feature of the Windows Server operating system providing fault tolerance and high availability. A set of server nodes (physical or virtual) are joined together as a cluster to provide resiliency in case of a failure. WSFC is commonly used to deploy infrastructure services include database, file, and namespaces servers.

VMware vSphere Storage APIs - Storage Awareness::
VASA is a set of APIs providing integration of the storage arrays with vCenter for management and administration. The architecture is based on several components including the _VASA Provider_ which handles communication between VMware vSphere and the storage systems. With ONTAP, the provider is implemented as part of ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere (OTV).

VMware vSphere Storage APIs - Array Integration::
VAAI is a set of APIs that enable communication between VMware vSphere ESXi hosts and the storage devices. The API includes a set of primitive operations used by the hosts to offload storage operations to the array. VAAI can provide significant performance improvements for storage-intensive tasks.

NetApp SnapCenter::
SnapCenter is a centralized and scalable platform providing data protection for applications, databases, host file systems, and virtual machines using ONTAP storage systems. It leverages the native ONTAP technologies including Snapshot, SnapRestore, FlexClone, SnapMirror, and SnapVault.

== NetApp plug-ins and related technologies

NetApp provides robust support for integrating ONTAP and related products with VMware vSphere technologies.

=== ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere

ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere (OTV) is a set of tools for integrating ONTAP and vSphere. It implements the provider functionality of the VASA API framework. OTV also includes the vCenter plug-in, a storage replication adapter (SRA) for VMware Site Recovery Manager, and a REST API server you can use to build automation applications. OTV incldes two variants: OTV 9.x (classic) and OTV 10.x (next generation). 

=== NFS Plug-In for VMware VAAI

The NetApp NFS Plug-In for VMware VAAI provides access to the VAAI features. The plug-in can be installed on ESXi hosts and allows the hosts to leverage VAAI with the NFS datastores on ONTAP. It provides several operations including cloning, space reservations, and snapshot offloading.

=== VMware Site Recovery Manager

VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM) provides a disaster recovery capability. SRM integrates with ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere to access and leverage the ONTAP data management functionality.

=== vSphere Metro Storage Cluster

vSphere Metro Storage Cluster (vMSC) is a technology that enables and supports vSphere in a _stretched cluster_ deployment. vMSC solutions are supported with NetApp MetroCluster and SnapMirror active sync (formerly SMBC). These solutions provide enhanced business continuity in the case of domain failure. The resiliency model is based on your specific configuration choices.

=== SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere

The SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere (SCV) is a Linux-based virtual appliance you can deploy together with the SnapCenter server or as a standalone application. In both cases, SCV provides backup and restore operations for VMs, datastores, and VMDKs. The operations are fast, space-efficient, crash-consistent, and VM-consistent.
