Accelerate your cluster performance by identifying the frequently accessed volumes (hot volumes) and data (hot objects).

[NOTE]
Beginning in ONTAP 9.10.1, you can use the Activity Tracking feature in File System Analytics to monitor hot objects in a volume. Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, Activity Tracking is expanded to the SVM scope. For more information, see xref:./file-system-analytics/activity-tracking-task.html[Enable Activity Tracking].

.Steps

. Click *Storage > Volumes*.
. Filter the IOPS, latency, and throughput columns to view the frequently accessed volumes and data.
