To provision a solid-state drive (SSD) cache, convert an existing local tier (aggregate) to a Flash Pool aggregate by adding SSDs. Flash Pool aggregates enable you to deploy Flash as a high-performance cache for your working dataset while using lower-cost HDDs for less frequently accessed data.

The process you use to provision an SSD cache and add it to a local tier depends on the version of ONTAP that you have installed.

== Use the CLI to create an SSD storage pool
Using the CLI in ONTAP 9.8 or later, create SSD storage pools to provide an SSD cache for two to four Flash Pool aggregates.

.Steps
. Perform the procedure in the _Disks and Aggregates Power Guide_: link:https://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.dot-cm-psmg/GUID-D3BFC47A-5545-4D94-A6E8-265057F58230.html[Creating an SSD storage pool].

== Use System Manager to add an SSD cache (ONTAP 9.7 only)

.Steps

.	Click *(Return to classic version)*.

.	Click *Storage > Aggregates & Disks > Aggregates*.

.	Select the local tier (aggregate), and then click *Actions > Add Cache*.

. Select the cache source as "storage pools" or "dedicated SSDs".

.	Click *(Switch to the new experience)*.

.	Click *Storage > Tiers* to verify the size of the new aggregate.
