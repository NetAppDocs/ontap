You can display information about audit policies that have been applied to files and directories by using the Security tab in the Windows Properties window. This is the same method used for data residing on a Windows server, which enables customers to use the same GUI interface that they are accustomed to using.

.About this task

Displaying information about audit policies applied to files and directories enables you to verify that you have the appropriate system access control lists (SACLs) set on specified files and folders.

To display information about SACLs that have been applied to NTFS files and folders, complete the following steps on a Windows host.

.Steps

. From the *Tools* menu in Windows Explorer, select *Map network drive*.
. Complete the *Map Network Drive* dialog box:
 .. Select a *Drive* letter.
 .. In the *Folder* box, type the IP address or SMB server name of the storage virtual machine (SVM) containing the share that holds both the data you would like to audit and the name of the share.
+
If your SMB server name is "`SMB_SERVER`" and your share is named "`share1`", you should enter `\\SMB_SERVER\share1`.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can specify the IP address of the data interface for the SMB server instead of the SMB server name.
====

 .. Click *Finish*.

+
The drive you selected is mounted and ready with the Windows Explorer window displaying files and folders contained within the share.
. Select the file or directory for which you display auditing information.
. Right-click on the file or directory, and select *Properties*.
. Select the *Security* tab.
. Click *Advanced*.
. Select the *Auditing* tab.
. Click *Continue*.
+
The Auditing box opens. The *Auditing entries* box displays a summary of users and groups that have SACLs applied to them.

. In the *Auditing entries* box select the user or group whose SACL entries you want displayed.
. Click *Edit*.
+
The Auditing entry for <object> box opens.

. In the *Access* box, view the current SACLs that are applied to the selected object.
. Click *Cancel* to close the *Auditing entry for <object>* box.
. Click *Cancel* to close the *Auditing* box.
