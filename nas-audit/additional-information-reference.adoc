After you have successfully tested SMB client access, you can perform advanced SMB configuration or add SAN access. After you have successfully tested NFS client access, you can perform advanced NFS configuration or add SAN access. When protocol access is complete, you should protect the root volume of SVM.

== SMB configuration
