After you have successfully tested SMB client access, you can perform advanced SMB configuration or add SAN access. After you have successfully tested NFS client access, you can perform advanced NFS configuration or add SAN access. When protocol access is complete, you should protect the root volume of SVM.

== SMB configuration

== Root volume protection

After configuring protocols on the SVM, you should ensure that its root volume is protected:

* link:../data-protection/index.html[Data protection]
+
Describes how to create a load-sharing mirror to protect the SVM root volume, which is a NetApp best practice for NAS-enabled SVMs. Also describes how to quickly recover from volume failures or losses by promoting the SVM root volume from a load-sharing mirror.
