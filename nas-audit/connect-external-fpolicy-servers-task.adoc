To enable file processing, you might need to manually connect to an external FPolicy server if the connection has previously been terminated. A connection is terminated after the server timeout is reached or due to some error. Alternatively, the administrator might manually terminate a connection.

.Steps

. Connect to the external FPolicy server by using the `vserver fpolicy engine-connect` command.
