Performing a security trace involves creating a security trace filter, verifying the filter criteria, generating access requests on an SMB or NFS client that match filter criteria, and viewing the results.

After you are finished using a security filter to capture trace information, you can modify the filter and reuse it, or disable it if you no longer need it. After viewing and analyzing the filter trace results, you can then delete them if they are no longer needed.
