There are certain considerations you must keep in mind when auditing symlinks and hard links.

An audit record contains information about the object being audited including the path to the audited object, which is identified in the `ObjectName` tag. You should be aware of how paths for symlinks and hard links are recorded in the `ObjectName` tag.

== Symlinks

A symlink is a file with a separate inode that contains a pointer to the location of a destination object, known as the target. When accessing an object through a symlink, ONTAP automatically interprets the symlink and follows the actual canonical protocol agnostic path to the target object in the volume.

In the following example output, there are two symlinks, both pointing to a file named `target.txt`. One of the symlinks is a relative symlink and one is an absolute symlink. If either of the symlinks are audited, the `ObjectName` tag in the audit event contains the path to the file `target.txt`:

[root@host1 audit]# ls -l
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 user1 group1 37 Apr  2 10:09 softlink_fullpath.txt -> /data/audit/target.txt
lrwxrwxrwx 1 user1 group1 10 Apr  2 09:54 softlink.txt -> target.txt
-rwxrwxrwx 1 user1 group1 16 Apr  2 10:05 target.txt

== Hard links

A hard link is a directory entry that associates a name with an existing file on a file system. The hard link points to the inode location of the original file. Similar to how ONTAP interprets symlinks, ONTAP interprets the hard link and follows the actual canonical path to the target object in the volume. When access to a hard link object is audited, the audit event records this absolute canonical path in the `ObjectName` tag rather than the hard link path.
