You need to know some additional information if you want to configure the FPolicy external engine to use SSL when connecting to FPolicy servers.

== SSL server authentication

If you choose to configure the FPolicy external engine for SSL server authentication, before creating the external engine, you must install the public certificate of the certificate authority (CA) that signed the FPolicy server certificate.

== Mutual authentication

If you configure FPolicy external engines to use SSL mutual authentication when connecting storage virtual machine (SVM) data LIFs to external FPolicy servers, before creating the external engine, you must install the public certificate of the CA that signed the FPolicy server certificate along with the public certificate and key file for authentication of the SVM. Do not delete this certificate while any FPolicy policies are using the installed certificate.

If the certificate is deleted while FPolicy is using it for mutual authentication when connecting to an external FPolicy server, you cannot reenable a disabled FPolicy policy that uses that certificate. The FPolicy policy cannot be reenabled in this situation even if a new certificate with the same settings is created and installed on the SVM.

If the certificate has been deleted, you need to install a new certificate, create new FPolicy external engines that use the new certificate, and associate the new external engines with the FPolicy policy that you want to reenable by modifying the FPolicy policy.

== Install certificates for SSL

The public certificate of the CA that is used to sign the FPolicy server certificate is installed by using the `security certificate install` command with the `-type` parameter set to `client-ca`. The private key and public certificate required for authentication of the SVM is installed by using the `security certificate install` command with the `-type` parameter set to `server`.
