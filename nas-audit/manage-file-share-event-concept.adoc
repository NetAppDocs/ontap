When a file-share event is configured for a storage virtual machine (SVM) and an audit is enabled, audit events are generated. The file-share events are generated when the SMB network share is modified using `vserver cifs share` related commands.

The file-share events with the event-ids 5142, 5143, and 5144 are generated when a SMB network share is added, modified, or deleted for the SVM. The SMB network share configuration is modified using the `cifs share access control create|modify|delete` commands.

The following example displays a file-share event with the ID 5143 is generated, when a share object called 'audit_dest' is created:
