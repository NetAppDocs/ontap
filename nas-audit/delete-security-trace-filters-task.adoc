When you no longer need a security trace filter entry, you can delete it. Because you can have a maximum of 10 security trace filters per storage virtual machine (SVM), deleting unneeded filters enables you to create new filters if you have reached the maximum.

.About this task

To uniquely identify the security trace filter that you want to delete, you must specify the following:

* The name of the SVM to which the trace filter is applied
* The filter index number of the trace filter

.Steps

. Identify the filter index number of the security trace filter entry you want to delete:
+
`vserver security trace filter show -vserver vserver_name`
+
`vserver security trace filter show -vserver vs1`
+
----

Vserver  Index   Client-IP            Path            Trace-Allow  Windows-Name
-------- -----  -----------  ----------------------   -----------  -------------
vs1        1    -            /dir1/dir2/file.txt          yes      -
vs1        2    -            /dir3/dir4/                  no       mydomain\joe
----

. Using the filter index number information from the previous step, delete the filter entry:
+
`vserver security trace filter delete -vserver vserver_name -index index_number`
+
`vserver security trace filter delete -vserver vs1 -index 1`

. Verify that the security trace filter entry is deleted:
+
`vserver security trace filter show -vserver vserver_name`
+
`vserver security trace filter show -vserver vs1`
+
----

Vserver  Index   Client-IP            Path            Trace-Allow   Windows-Name
-------- -----  -----------  ----------------------   -----------   -------------
vs1        2    -            /dir3/dir4/                  no        mydomain\joe
