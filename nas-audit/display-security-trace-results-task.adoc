[.lead]
You can display the security trace results generated for file operations that match security trace filters. You can use the results to validate your file access security configuration or to troubleshoot SMB and NFS file access issues.

.What you'll need

An enabled security trace filter must exist and operations must have been performed from an SMB or NFS client that matches the security trace filter to generate security trace results.

.About this task

You can display a summary of all security trace results, or you can customize what information is displayed in the output by specifying optional parameters. This can be helpful when the security trace results contain a large number of records.

If you do not specify any of the optional parameters, the following is displayed:

* storage virtual machine (SVM) name
* Node name
* Security trace index number
* Security style
* Path
* Reason
* User name
+
The user name is displayed depending on how the trace filter is configured:
+
[cols="40,60"]
|===

h| If the filter is configured... h| Then...

a|
With a UNIX user name
a|
The security trace result displays the UNIX user name.
a|
With a Windows user name
a|
The security trace result displays the Windows user name.
a|
Without a user name
a|
The security trace result displays the Windows user name.
|===

You can customize the output by using optional parameters. Some of the optional parameters that you can use to narrow the results returned in the command output include the following:

[cols="35,65"]
|===

h| Optional parameter h| Description
a|
`-fields` `field_name`, ...
a|
Displays output on the fields you choose. You can use this parameter either alone or in combination with other optional parameters.
a|
`-instance`
a|
Displays detailed information about security trace events. Use this parameter with other optional parameters to display detailed information about specific filter results.
a|
`-node` `node_name`
a|
Displays information only about events on the specified node.
a|
`-vserver` `vserver_name`
a|
Displays information only about events on the specified SVM.
a|
`-index` `integer`
a|
Displays information about the events that occurred as a result of the filter corresponding to the specified index number.
a|
`-client-ip` `IP_address`
a|
Displays information about the events that occurred as a result of file access from the specified client IP address.
a|
`-path` `path`
a|
Displays information about the events that occurred as a result of file access to the specified path.
a|
`-user-name` `user_name`
a|
Displays information about the events that occurred as a result of file access by the specified Windows or UNIX user.
a|
`-security-style` `security_style`
a|
Displays information about the events that occurred on file systems with the specified security style.

.Step

. Display security trace filter results by using the `vserver security trace trace-result show` command.
