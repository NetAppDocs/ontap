You can enable FPolicy policies after the configuration is complete. Enabling the policy sets its priority and starts file access monitoring for the policy. You can disable FPolicy policies if you want to stop file access monitoring for the policy.

.Before you begin

Before enabling FPolicy policies, the FPolicy configuration must be completed.

.About this task

* The priority is used when multiple policies are enabled on the storage virtual machine (SVM) and more than one policy has subscribed to the same file access event.
* Policies that use the native engine configuration have a higher priority than policies for any other engine, regardless of the sequence number assigned to them when enabling the policy.
* If you want to change the priority of an FPolicy policy, you must disable the policy and then reenable it using the new sequence number.
