You must create an external engine to start creating an FPolicy configuration. The external engine defines how FPolicy makes and manages connections to external FPolicy servers. If your configuration uses the internal ONTAP engine (the native external engine) for simple file blocking, you do not need to configure a separate FPolicy external engine and do not need to perform this step.

.Before you begin

The link:fpolicy-external-engine-config-worksheet-reference.html[external engine] worksheet should be completed.

.About this task

If the external engine is used in a MetroCluster configuration, you should specify the IP addresses of the FPolicy servers at the source site as primary servers. The IP addresses of the FPolicy servers at the destination site should be specified as secondary servers.

.Steps

. Create the FPolicy external engine by using the `vserver fpolicy policy external-engine create` command.
+
The following command creates an external engine on storage virtual machine (SVM) vs1.example.com. No authentication is required for external communications with the FPolicy server.
+
`vserver fpolicy policy external-engine create -vserver-name vs1.example.com -engine-name engine1 -primary-servers 10.1.1.2,10.1.1.3 -port 6789 -ssl-option no-auth`

. Verify the FPolicy external engine configuration by using the `vserver fpolicy policy external-engine show` command.
+
The following command display information about all external engines configured on SVM vs1.example.com:
+
`vserver fpolicy policy external-engine show -vserver vs1.example.com`
+
