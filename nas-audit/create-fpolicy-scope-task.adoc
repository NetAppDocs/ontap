After creating the FPolicy policy, you need to create an FPolicy scope. When creating the scope, you associate the scope with an FPolicy policy. A scope defines the boundaries on which the FPolicy policy applies. Scopes can include or exclude files based on shares, export policies, volumes, and file extensions.

.Before you begin

The FPolicy scope worksheet must be completed. The FPolicy policy must exist with an associated external engine (if the policy is configured to use external FPolicy servers) and must have at least one associated FPolicy event.

.Steps

. Create the FPolicy scope by using the `vserver fpolicy policy scope create` command.
+
`vserver fpolicy policy scope create -vserver-name vs1.example.com -policy-name policy1 -volumes-to-include datavol1,datavol2`

. Verify the FPolicy scope configuration by using the `vserver fpolicy policy scope show` command.
+
`vserver fpolicy policy scope show -vserver vs1.example.com -instance`
