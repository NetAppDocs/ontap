You can use this worksheet to record the values that you need during the FPolicy event configuration process. If a parameter value is required, you need to determine what value to use for those parameters before you configure the FPolicy event.

You should record whether you want to include each parameter setting in the FPolicy event configuration and then record the value for the parameters that you want to include.
