When authorization-policy-change event is configured for a storage virtual machine (SVM) and an audit is enabled, audit events are generated.

The authorization-policy-change events with the event-ids 4704 and 4705 are generated whenever the authorization rights are granted or revoked for an SMB user and SMB group. The authorization-policy-change events are generated when the authorization rights are assigned or revoked using `vserver cifs users-and-groups privilege` related commands.

The following example displays an authorization policy event with the ID 4704 generated, when the authorization rights for a SMB user group are assigned:
