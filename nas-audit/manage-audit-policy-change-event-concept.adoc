When an audit-policy-change event is configured for a storage virtual machine (SVM) and an audit is enabled, audit events are generated. The audit-policy-change events are generated when an audit policy is modified using `vserver audit` related commands.

The audit-policy-change event with the event-id 4719 is generated whenever an audit policy is disabled, enabled, or modified and helps to identify when a user attempts to disable auditing to cover the tracks. It is configured by default and requires diagnostic privilege to disable.

The following example displays an audit-policy change event with the ID 4719 generated, when an audit is disabled:
