= Delete security trace records on ONTAP SVMs

[.lead]
After you finish using a filter trace record to verify file access security or to troubleshoot SMB or NFS client access issues, you can delete the security trace record from the security trace log.

.About this task

Before you can delete a security trace record, you must know the record's sequence number.

[NOTE]
====
Each storage virtual machine (SVM) can store a maximum of 128 trace records. If the maximum is reached on the SVM, the oldest trace records are automatically deleted as new ones are added. If you do not want to manually delete trace records on this SVM, you can let ONTAP automatically delete the oldest trace results after the maximum is reached to make room for new results.
====

.Steps

. Identify the sequence number of the record you want to delete:
+
`vserver security trace trace-result show -vserver vserver_name -instance`
. Delete the security trace record:
+
`vserver security trace trace-result delete -node node_name -vserver vserver_name -seqnum integer`
+
`vserver security trace trace-result delete -vserver vs1 -node node1 -seqnum 999`

 ** `-node` `node_name` is the name of the cluster node on which the permission tracing event that you want to delete occurred.
+
This is a required parameter.

 ** `-vserver` `vserver_name` is the name of the SVM on which the permission tracing event that you want to delete occurred.
+
This is a required parameter.

 ** `-seqnum` `integer` is the sequence number of the log event that you want to delete.
+
This is a required parameter.
