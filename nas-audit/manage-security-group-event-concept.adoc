When a security-group event is configured for a storage virtual machine (SVM) and an audit is enabled, audit events are generated.

The security-group events with event-ids 4731, 4732, 4733, 4734, and 4735 are generated when a local SMB or NFS group is created or deleted from the system, and local user is added or removed from the group. The security-group-events are generated when a user account is modified using `vserver cifs users-and-groups _<local-group>_` and `vserver services name-service _<unix-group>_` commands.

The following example displays a security group event with the ID 4731 generated, when a local UNIX security group is created:
