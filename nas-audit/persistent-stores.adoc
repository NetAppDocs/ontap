summary: "Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, FPolicy allows you to setup a persistent store to capture file access events for asynchronous non-mandatory policies in the SVM. Persistent stores can help decouple client I/O processing from the FPolicy notification processing to reduce client latency. Synchronous and asynchronous mandatory configurations are not supported."

Persistent stores can help decouple client I/O processing from FPolicy notification processing to reduce client latency. Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can set up an FPolicy persistent store to capture file access events for asynchronous non-mandatory policies in the SVM. Synchronous (either mandatory or non-mandatory) and asynchronous mandatory configurations are not supported.

This feature is only available in FPolicy external mode. The partner application you use needs to support this feature. You should work with your partner to ensure this FPolicy configuration is supported.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.15.1, FPolicy persistent store configuration is simplified. The `persistent-store create` command automates volume creation for the SVM and configures the volume with persistent store best practices.
