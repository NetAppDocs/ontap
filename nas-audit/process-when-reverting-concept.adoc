If you plan to revert the cluster, you should be aware of the revert process ONTAP follows when there are auditing-enabled storage virtual machines (SVMs) in the cluster. You must take certain actions before reverting.

== Reverting to a version of ONTAP that does not support the auditing of SMB logon and logoff events and central access policy staging events

Support for auditing of SMB logon and logoff events and for central access policy staging events starts with clustered Data ONTAP 8.3. If you are reverting to a version of ONTAP that does not support these event types and you have auditing configurations that monitor these event types, you must change the auditing configuration for those audit-enabled SVMs before reverting. You must modify the configuration so that only file-op events are audited.
