Before you can view the audit event logs, the logs must be converted to user-readable formats. If you want to view the event logs for a specific storage virtual machine (SVM) before ONTAP automatically rotates the log, you can manually rotate the audit event logs on an SVM.

.Step

. Rotate the audit event logs by using the `vserver audit rotate-log` command.
+
`vserver audit rotate-log -vserver vs1`
+
The audit event log is saved in the SVM audit event log directory with the format specified by the auditing configuration (`XML` or `EVTX`), and can be viewed by using the appropriate application.
