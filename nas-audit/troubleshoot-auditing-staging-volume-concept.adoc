Issues can arise when there is insufficient space on either the staging volumes or on the volume containing the audit event logs. If there is insufficient space, new audit records cannot be created, which prevents clients from accessing data, and access requests fail. You should know how to troubleshoot and resolve these volume space issues.

== Troubleshoot space issues related to the event log volumes

If volumes containing event log files run out of space, auditing cannot convert log records into log files. This results in client access failures. You must know how to troubleshoot space issues related to event log volumes.

* storage virtual machine (SVM) and cluster administrators can determine whether there is insufficient volume space by displaying information about volume and aggregate usage and configuration.
* If there is insufficient space in the volumes containing event logs, SVM and cluster administrators can resolve the space issues by either removing some of the event log files or by increasing the size of the volume.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the aggregate that contains the event log volume is full, then the size of the aggregate must be increased before you can increase the size of the volume. Only a cluster administrator can increase the size of an aggregate.
====

* The destination path for the event log files can be changed to a directory on another volume by modifying the auditing configuration.
+
[NOTE]
====
Data access is denied in the following cases:

-   If the destination directory is deleted.

-   If the file limit on a volume, which hosts the destination directory, reaches to its maximum level.
+
====

== Troubleshoot space issues related to the staging volumes

If any of the volumes containing staging files for your storage virtual machine (SVM) runs out of space, auditing cannot write log records into staging files. This results in client access failures. To troubleshoot this issue, you need to determine whether any of the staging volumes used in the SVM are full by displaying information about volume usage.

If the volume containing the consolidated event log files has sufficient space but there are still client access failures due to insufficient space, then the staging volumes might be out of space. The SVM administrator must contact you to determine whether the staging volumes that contain staging files for the SVM have insufficient space. The auditing subsystem generates an EMS event if auditing events cannot be generated due to insufficient space in a staging volume. The following message is displayed: `No space left on device`. Only you can view information about staging volumes; SVM administrators cannot.

All staging volume names begin with `MDV_aud_` followed by the UUID of the aggregate containing that staging volume. The following example shows four system volumes on the admin SVM, which were automatically created when a file services auditing configuration was created for a data SVM in the cluster:

If there is insufficient space in the staging volumes, you can resolve the space issues by increasing the size of the volume.

[NOTE]
====
If the aggregate that contains the staging volume is full, then the size of the aggregate must be increased before you can increase the size of the volume. Only you can increase the size of an aggregate; SVM administrators cannot.
====

If one or more aggregates have an available space of less than 2 GB, the SVM audit creation fails. When the SVM audit creation fails, the staging volumes that were created are deleted.
