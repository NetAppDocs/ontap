When you configure your FPolicy event, you need to be aware that only certain combinations of file operations and filters are supported for monitoring NFSv4 file access operations.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.15.1, FPolicy supports the NFSv4.1 protocol. 

The list of supported file operation and filter combinations for FPolicy monitoring of NFSv4 or NFSv4.1 file access events is provided in the following table:
