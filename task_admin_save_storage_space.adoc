[.lead]
For volumes on non-AFF clusters, you can run deduplication, data compression, and data compaction together or independently to achieve optimal space savings.

* Deduplication eliminates duplicate data blocks.

* Data compression compresses the data blocks to reduce the amount of physical storage that is required.

* Data compaction stores more data in less space to increase storage efficiency.

[NOTE]
These tasks are supported for volumes on non-AFF clusters. Beginning with ONTAP 9.2, all inline storage efficiency features, such as inline deduplication and inline compression, are enabled by default on AFF volumes.

.Steps

. Click *Storage > Volumes*.

. Next to the name of the volume for which you want to save storage, click image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon].

. Click *Edit* and scroll to *Storage Efficiency*.

. _Optional_: If you want to enable background deduplication, ensure the checkbox is checked.

. _Optional_: If you want to enable background compression, specify the storage efficiency policy and ensure the checkbox is checked.

. _Optional_: If you want to enable inline compression, ensure the checkbox is checked.
