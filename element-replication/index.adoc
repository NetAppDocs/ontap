You can ensure business continuity on an Element system by using SnapMirror to replicate snapshots of an Element volume to an ONTAP destination. In the event of a disaster at the Element site, you can serve data to clients from the ONTAP system, and then reactivate the Element system when service is restored.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.4, you can replicate snapshots of a LUN created on an ONTAP node back to an Element system. You might have created a LUN during an outage at the Element site, or you might be using a LUN to migrate data from ONTAP to Element software.
