= Make the destination volume writeable
:icons: font

[.lead]
When disaster disables the primary site for a SnapMirror DR relationship, you can serve data from the destination volume with minimal disruption. You can reactivate the source volume when service is restored at the primary site.

You need to make the destination volume writeable before you can serve data from the volume to clients. You can use the `snapmirror quiesce` command to stop scheduled transfers to the destination, the `snapmirror abort` command to stop ongoing transfers, and the `snapmirror break` command to make the destination writeable.

.About this task

You must specify the Element source path in the form `<hostip:>/lun/<name>`, where "`lun`" is the actual string "`lun`" and `name` is the name of the Element volume.

.Steps

. Stop scheduled transfers to the destination:
+
`snapmirror quiesce -source-path <hostip:>/lun/<name> -destination-path <SVM:volume>|<cluster://SVM/volume>`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
The following example stops scheduled transfers between the source volume `0005` at IP address 10.0.0.11 and the destination volume `volA_dst` on `svm_backup`:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror quiesce -source-path 10.0.0.11:/lun/0005 -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst
----

. Stop ongoing transfers to the destination:
+
`snapmirror abort -source-path <hostip:>/lun/<name> -destination-path <SVM:volume>|<cluster://SVM/volume>`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
The following example stops ongoing transfers between the source volume `0005` at IP address 10.0.0.11 and the destination volume `volA_dst` on `svm_backup`:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror abort -source-path 10.0.0.11:/lun/0005 -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst
----

. Break the SnapMirror DR relationship:
+
`snapmirror break -source-path <hostip:>/lun/<name> -destination-path <SVM:volume>|<cluster://SVM/volume>`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
The following example breaks the relationship between the source volume `0005` at IP address 10.0.0.11 and the destination volume `volA_dst` on `svm_backup` and the destination volume `volA_dst` on `svm_backup`:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror break -source-path 10.0.0.11:/lun/0005 -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst
