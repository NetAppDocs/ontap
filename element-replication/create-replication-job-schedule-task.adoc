Whether you are replicating data from Element to ONTAP or from ONTAP to Element, you need to configure a job schedule, specify a policy, and create and initialize the relationship. You can use a default or custom policy.

You can use the `job schedule cron create` command to create a replication job schedule. The job schedule determines when SnapMirror automatically updates the data protection relationship to which the schedule is assigned.

.About this task

You assign a job schedule when you create a data protection relationship. If you do not assign a job schedule, you must update the relationship manually.

.Step

. Create a job schedule:
+
`job schedule cron create -name _job_name_ -month _month_ -dayofweek _day_of_week_ -day _day_of_month_ -hour _hour_ -minute _minute_`
+
For `-month`, `-dayofweek`, and `-hour`, you can specify `all` to run the job every month, day of the week, and hour, respectively.
+
The following example creates a job schedule named `my_weekly` that runs on Saturdays at 3:00 a.m.:
+
----
cluster_dst::> job schedule cron create -name my_weekly -dayofweek "Saturday" -hour 3 -minute 0
