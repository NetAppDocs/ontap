To provide SMB client access to shared storage on an SVM, you must create a volume or qtree to provide a storage container, and then create or modify a share for that container. You can then configure share and file permissions, and test access from client systems.

.Before you begin

* SMB must be completely set up on the SVM.
* Any updates to your name services configuration must be complete.
* Any additions or modifications to an Active Directory domain or workgroup configuration must be complete.
