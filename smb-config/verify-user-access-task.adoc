You should test that the users you configured can access the SMB share and the files it contains.

.Steps

. On a Windows client, log in as one of the users who now has access to the share.
. From the *Tools* menu in Windows Explorer, select *Map network drive*.
. Complete the *Map Network Drive* box:
 .. Select a *Drive* letter.
 .. In the *Folder* box, type the share name you will provide to users.
+
If your SMB server name is SMB_SERVER01 and your share is named "`SHARE1`", you would enter `\\SMB_SERVER01\share1`.

 .. Click *Finish*.

+
The drive you selected is mounted and ready with the Windows Explorer window displaying files and folders contained within the share.
. Create a test file, verify that it exists, write text to it, and then remove the test file.
