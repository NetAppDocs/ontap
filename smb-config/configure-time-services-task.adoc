Before creating an SMB server in an Active Domain controller, you must ensure that the cluster time and the time on the domain controllers of the domain to which the SMB server will belong matches to within five minutes.

.About this task

You should configure cluster NTP services to use the same NTP servers for time synchronization that the Active Directory domain uses.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.5, you can set up your NTP server with symmetric authentication.

.Steps

. Configure time services by using the `cluster time-service ntp server create` command.
 ** To configure time services without symmetric authentication enter the following command: `cluster time-service ntp server create -server server_ip_address`
 ** To configure time services with symmetric authentication, enter the following command: `cluster time-service ntp server create -server server_ip_address -key-id key_id`
`cluster time-service ntp server create -server 10.10.10.1` `cluster time-service ntp server create -server 10.10.10.2`
. Verify that time services are set up correctly by using the `cluster time-service ntp server show` command.
