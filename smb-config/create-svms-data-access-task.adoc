[.lead]
If you do not already have at least one SVM in a cluster to provide data access to SMB clients, you must create one.

.Before you begin

include::../_include/svm-limits.adoc[]

.Steps

. Create an SVM: `vserver create -vserver _svm_name_ -rootvolume _root_volume_name_ -aggregate _aggregate_name_ -rootvolume-security-style ntfs -language C.UTF-8 -ipspace _ipspace_name_`
 ** Use the NTFS setting for the `-rootvolume-security-style` option.
 ** Use the default C.UTF-8 `-language` option.
 ** The `ipspace` setting is optional.
. Verify the configuration and status of the newly created SVM: `vserver show -vserver _vserver_name_`
+
The `Allowed Protocols` field must include CIFS. You can edit this list later.
+
The `Vserver Operational State` field must display the `running` state. If it displays the `initializing` state, it means that some intermediate operation such as root volume creation failed, and you must delete the SVM and re-create it.

.Examples

The following command creates an SVM for data access in the IPspace `ipspaceA`:

----
cluster1::> vserver create -vserver vs1.example.com -rootvolume root_vs1 -aggregate aggr1
-rootvolume-security-style ntfs -language C.UTF-8 -ipspace ipspaceA

[Job 2059] Job succeeded:
Vserver creation completed
----

The following command shows that an SVM was created with a root volume of 1 GB, and it was started automatically and is in `running` state. The root volume has a default export policy that does not include any rules, so the root volume is not exported upon creation.

----
cluster1::> vserver show -vserver vs1.example.com
