You can use ONTAP 9 CLI commands to configure SMB client access to files contained in a new volume or qtree in a new or existing SVM.

[NOTE]
====
_SMB_ (Server Message Block) refers to modern dialects of the Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol. You will still see _CIFS_ in the ONTAP command-line interface (CLI) and in OnCommand management tools.
====

Use these procedures if you want to configure SMB access to a volume or qtree in the following way:

* You want to use SMB version 2 or later.
* You want to serve SMB clients only, not NFS clients (not a multiprotocol configuration).
* NTFS file permissions will be used to secure the new volume.
* You have cluster administrator privileges, not SVM administrator privileges.
+
Cluster administrator privileges are required to create SVMs and LIFs. SVM administrator privileges are sufficient for other SMB configuration tasks.

* You want to use the CLI, not System Manager or an automated scripting tool.
+
To use System Manager to configure NAS multiprotocol access, see link:../task_nas_provision_nfs_and_smb.html[Provision NAS storage for both Windows and Linux using both NFS and SMB].

* You want to use best practices, not explore every available option.
+
Learn more about the commands described in this procedure in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/[ONTAP command reference^].

If you want details about the range of ONTAP SMB protocol capabilities, consult the link:../smb-admin/index.html[SMB reference overview].
