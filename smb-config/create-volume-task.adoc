You can create a volume and specify its junction point and other properties by using the `volume create` command.

.About this task

A volume must include a _junction path_ for its data to be made available to clients. You can specify the junction path when you create a new volume. If you create a volume without specifying a junction path, you must _mount_ the volume in the SVM namespace using the `volume mount` command.

.Before you begin

* SMB should be set up and running.
* The SVM security style must be NTFS.
include::../_include/file-system-analytics-default.adoc[]

.Steps

. Create the volume with a junction point: `volume create -vserver _svm_name_ -volume _volume_name_ -aggregate _aggregate_name_ -size {integer[KB|MB|GB|TB|PB]} -security-style ntfs -junction-path _junction_path_]`
+
The choices for `-junction-path` are the following:

 ** Directly under root, for example, `/new_vol`
+
You can create a new volume and specify that it be mounted directly to the SVM root volume.

 ** Under an existing directory, for example, `/existing_dir/new_vol`
+
You can create a new volume and specify that it be mounted to an existing volume (in an existing hierarchy), expressed as a directory.

+
If you want to create a volume in a new directory (in a new hierarchy under a new volume), for example, `/new_dir/new_vol`, then you must first create a new parent volume that is junctioned to the SVM root volume. You would then create the new child volume in the junction path of the new parent volume (new directory).

. Verify that the volume was created with the desired junction point: `volume show -vserver _svm_name_ -volume _volume_name_ -junction`

.Examples

The following command creates a new volume named users1 on the SVM vs1.example.com and the aggregate aggr1. The new volume is made available at `/users`. The volume is 750 GB in size, and its volume guarantee is of type volume (by default).

cluster1::> volume create -vserver vs1.example.com -volume users -aggregate aggr1 -size 750g -junction-path /users
[Job 1642] Job succeeded: Successful

cluster1::> volume show -vserver vs1.example.com -volume users -junction
                          Junction                 Junction
Vserver           Volume  Active   Junction Path   Path Source
----------------- ------- -------- --------------- -----------
vs1.example.com   users1  true     /users          RW_volume
----

The following command creates a new volume named "`home4`" on the SVM"`vs1.example.com`" and the aggregate "`aggr1`". The directory `/eng/` already exists in the namespace for the vs1 SVM, and the new volume is made available at `/eng/home`, which becomes the home directory for the `/eng/` namespace. The volume is 750 GB in size, and its volume guarantee is of type `volume` (by default).

----
cluster1::> volume create -vserver vs1.example.com -volume home4 -aggregate aggr1 -size 750g -junction-path /eng/home
[Job 1642] Job succeeded: Successful

cluster1::> volume show -vserver vs1.example.com -volume home4 -junction
                         Junction                 Junction
Vserver          Volume  Active   Junction Path   Path Source
---------------- ------- -------- --------------- -----------
vs1.example.com  home4   true     /eng/home       RW_volume
