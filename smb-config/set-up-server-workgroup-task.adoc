Setting up an SMB server as a member in a workgroup consists of creating the SMB server, and then creating local users and groups.

You can configure an SMB server in a workgroup when the Microsoft Active Directory domain infrastructure is not available.

An SMB server in workgroup mode supports only NTLM authentication and does not support Kerberos authentication.
