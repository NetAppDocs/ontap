Before providing SMB storage to clients, you must verify that networking is correctly configured to meet the SMB provisioning requirements.

.Before you begin

The following cluster networking objects must be configured:

* Physical and logical ports
* Broadcast domains
* Subnets (if required)
* IPspaces (as required, in addition to the default IPspace)
* Failover groups (as required, in addition to the default failover group for each broadcast domain)
* External firewalls

.Steps

. Display the available physical and virtual ports: `network port show`
 ** When possible, you should use the port with the highest speed for the data network.
 ** All components in the data network must have the same MTU setting for best performance.

. If you are planning to use a subnet name to allocate the IP address and network mask value for a LIF, verify that the subnet exists and has sufficient addresses available: `network subnet show`
+
Subnets contain a pool of IP addresses that belong to the same layer 3 subnet. Subnets are created by using the `network subnet create` command.

. Display available IPspaces: `network ipspace show`
+
You can use the default IPspace or a custom IPspace.
+
Learn more about `network ipspace show` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/network-ipspace-show.html[ONTAP command reference^].
. If you want to use IPv6 addresses, verify that IPv6 is enabled on the cluster: `network options ipv6 show`
+
If required, you can enable IPv6 by using the `network options ipv6 modify` command.
