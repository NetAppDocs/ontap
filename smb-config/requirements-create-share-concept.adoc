Before creating an SMB share, you must understand requirements for share paths and share properties, particularly for home directories.

Creating an SMB share entails specifying a directory path structure (using the `-path` option in the `vserver cifs share create` command) that clients will access. The directory path corresponds to the junction path for a volume or qtree that you created in the SVM namespace. The directory path and corresponding junction path must exist before creating your share.

Share paths have the following requirements:

* A directory path name can be up to 255 characters long.
* If there is a space in the path name, the entire string must be put in quotes (for example, `"/new volume/mount here"`).
* If the UNC path (`\\servername\sharename\filepath`) of the share contains more than 256 characters (excluding the initial "`\\`" in the UNC path), then the *Security* tab in the Windows Properties box is unavailable.
+
This is a Windows client issue rather than an ONTAP issue. To avoid this issue, do not create shares with UNC paths with more than 256 characters.

Share property defaults can be changed:

* The default initial properties for all shares are `oplocks`, `browsable`, `changenotify`, and `show-previous-versions`.
* It is optional to specify share properties when you create a share.
+
However, if you do specify share properties when you create the share, the defaults are not used. If you use the `-share-properties` parameter when you create a share, you must specify all of the share properties that you want to apply to the share using a comma-delimited list.

* To designate a home directory share, use the `homedirectory` property.
+
This feature enables you to configure a share that maps to different directories based on the user that connects to it and a set of variables. Instead of having to create separate shares for each user, you can configure a single share with a few home directory parameters to define a user's relationship between an entry point (the share) and their home directory (a directory on the SVM).
+
[NOTE]
====
You cannot add or remove this property after creating the share.

Home directory shares have the following requirements:

* Before creating SMB home directories, you must add at least one home directory search path by using the `vserver cifs home-directory search-path add` command.
* Home directory shares specified by the value of `homedirectory` on the `-share-properties` parameter must include the `%w` (Windows user name) dynamic variable in the share name.
+
The share name can additionally contain the `%d` (domain name) dynamic variable (for example, `%d/%w`) or a static portion in the share name (for example, `home1_%w`).

* If the share is used by administrators or users to connect to other users' home directories (using options to the `vserver cifs home-directory modify` command), the dynamic share name pattern must be preceded by a tilde (`~`).
