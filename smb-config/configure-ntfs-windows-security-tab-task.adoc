To enable file access to the users or groups who have access to a share, you must configure NTFS file permissions on files and directories in that share from a Windows client.

.Before you begin

The administrator performing this task must have sufficient NTFS permissions to change permissions on the selected objects.

.About this task

link:../smb-admin/index.html[SMB management] and your Windows documentation contain information about how to set standard and advanced NTFS permissions.

.Steps

. Log in to a Windows client as an administrator.
. From the *Tools* menu in Windows Explorer, select *Map network drive*.
. Complete the *Map Network Drive* box:
 .. Select a *Drive* letter.
 .. In the *Folder* box, type the SMB server name containing the share that contains the data to which you want to apply permissions and the name of the share.
+
If your SMB server name is SMB_SERVER01 and your share is named "`SHARE1`", you would enter `\\SMB_SERVER01\SHARE1`.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can specify the IP address of the data interface for the SMB server instead of the SMB server name.
====

 .. Click *Finish*.

+
The drive you selected is mounted and ready with the Windows Explorer window displaying files and folders contained within the share.
. Select the file or directory for which you want to set NTFS file permissions.
. Right-click the file or directory, and then select *Properties*.
. Select the *Security* tab.
+
The Security tab displays the list of users and groups for which NTFS permission are set. The Permissions for <Object> box displays a list of Allow and Deny permissions in effect for the selected user or group.

. Click *Edit*.
+
The Permissions for <Object> box opens.

If some or all of the standard permission boxes are not selectable, it is because the permissions are inherited from the parent object. The *Special permissions* box is not selectable. If it is selected, it means that one or more of the granular advanced rights has been set for the selected user or group.
====

. After you finish adding, removing, or editing NTFS permissions on that object, click *OK*.
