summary: "If you do not already have an SVM configured for SMB client access, you must either create and configure a new SVM or configure an existing SVM. Configuring SMB involves opening SVM root volume access, creating an SMB server, creating a LIF, enabling host-name resolution, configuring name services, and if desired, enabling Kerberos security."

If you do not already have an SVM configured for SMB client access, you must either create and configure a new SVM or configure an existing SVM. Configuring SMB involves opening SVM root volume access, creating an SMB server, creating a LIF, enabling host-name resolution, configuring name services, and if desired, enabling Kerberos security.
