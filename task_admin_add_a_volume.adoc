You can create a volume and add it to an existing storage VM that is configured for NFS or SMB service.

.Before you begin

* A storage VM that is configured for NFS or SMB service should exist in the cluster.
include::./_include/file-system-analytics-default-sm.adoc[]

.Steps

. Go to *Storage > Volumes*.
. Select image:icon_add.gif[Add icon].
. Specify a name and size for the volume.
. Perform one of the following steps:
+
[cols="35,65"]
|===

h|Select this button...  h|To perform this action...

|*Save*
|The volume is created and added using the system defaults.  No additional steps are required.

| *More Options*
|Proceed to <<step5>> to define the specifications for the volume.

|===
. [[step5,Step 5]] The volume name and size are shown if you previously specified them.  Otherwise, enter the name and size.
. Select a storage VM from the pull-down list.
+
Only storage VMs configured with the NFS protocol are listed. If only one storage VM configured with the NFS protocol is available, the *Storage VM* field is not shown.
. To add a cache for the remote volume, select *Add a cache for remote volume* and specify the following values:
+
* Select a cluster.
* Select a storage VM.
* Select the volume that you want to be a cache volume.
. In the *Storage and Optimization* section, specify the following values:
+
.. The capacity of the volume is already shown, but you can modify it.
.. In the *Performance Service Level* field, select a service level:
+
[cols="60,40"]
|===

h| When you select this service level... h| This occurs...

a| An existing service level, such as "Extreme", "Performance", or "Value".

Only the service levels that are valid for the system platform (AFF, FAS, or others) are displayed.
| A local tier or tiers are automatically chosen.  Proceed to <<step9>>.

| Custom
| Proceed to <<step8c>> to define a new service level.

|===
+
.. [[step8c, Step 8c]] Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, you can use System Manager to manually select the local tier on which you want to place the volume you are creating (if you have selected the "Custom" service level).
+
NOTE: This option is not available if you select *Add as a cache for a remote volume* or *Distribute volume data across the cluster* (see below).
+

[cols"30,70"]
|===

h| When you make this choice... h| You perform these steps...

| *Manual placement*
| Manual placement is enabled.  The *Distribute volume data across the cluster* selection is disabled (see below). Proceed to <<step8d>> to complete the process.

| No selection
| Manual placement is not enabled.  The local tier is automatically selected.  Proceed to <<step9>>.

|===

.. [[step8d,Step 8d]] Select a local tier from the pull-down menu.

.. Select a QoS policy.
+
Select "Existing" to choose from a list of existing policies, or select "New" to enter the specifications of a new policy.

. [[step9,Step 9]] In the *Optimization options* section, determine if you want to distribute the volume data across the cluster:
+
[cols="40,60"]
|===

h| When you make this choice... h| This occurs...

| *Distribute volume data across the cluster*
| The volume you are adding becomes a FlexGroup volume.  This option is not available if you previously selected *Manual placement*.

| No selection
| The volume you are adding becomes a FlexVol volume by default.

|===

. In the *Access Permissions* section, specify the access permissions for the protocols for which the volume is configured.
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, the new volume will not be shareable by default. You can specify the default access permissions by ensuring the following check boxes are checked:
+
* *Export via NGS*: Creates the volume with the "`default`" export policy that grants users full access to the data.
+
* *Share via SMB/CIFS*: Creates a share with an auto-generated name, which you can edit.  Access is granted to "`Everyone`". Also, you can specify the permission level.

. In the *Protection* section, specify the protections for the volume.  
+
* Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, you can select *Enable Snapshot Copies (Local)* and choose a Snapshot copy policy rather than using the default.
+
* If you select *Enable SnapMirror (Local or Remote)*, then specify the protection policy and settings for the destination cluster from the pull-down lists.

. Select *Save*.
+
The volume is created and added to the cluster and storage VM.
+
NOTE: You can also save the specifications of this volume to an Ansible Playbook.  For more details, go to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/task_use_ansible_playbooks_add_edit_volumes_luns.html[Use Ansible Playbooks to add or edit volumes or LUNs^].
