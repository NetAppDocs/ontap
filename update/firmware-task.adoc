Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, if you are registered with link:https://netapp.com/support-and-training/documentation/active-iq-unified-manager[Active IQ Unified Manager^], you can receive alerts in System Manager that inform you when firmware updates for supported devices, such as disk, disk shelves, the service processor (SP), or the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) are pending on the cluster. 

If you are running ONTAP 9.8 or you are not registered with Active IQ Unified Manager, you can navigate to the NetApp Support Site to download firmware updates.


.Before you begin

To prepare for a smooth firmware update, you should reboot the SP or BMC before the update begins. You can use the `system service-processor reboot-sp -node node_name` command to reboot.


.Steps
Follow the appropriate procedure based upon your version of ONTAP and if you are registered with Active IQ Unified Manager.
