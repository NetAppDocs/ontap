Enable automatic updates to allow ONTAP to download and install firmware, system, and security updates without your intervention.

Enabling automatic updates requires that you accept the terms of a EULA and confirm or configure the default update behavior for each system component as appropriate for your environment.

The availability of automatic updates for each system component depends on your ONTAP version.

.Before you begin

* You must have a current support entitlement. You can check this on the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/[NetApp support site^] in the *System Details* page.

* To enable automatic updates, you must first enable AutoSupport with HTTPS. If AutoSupport is not enabled on your cluster, or if AutoSupport is enabled on your cluster with another transport protocol, you can enable it with HTTPS during this procedure.

NOTE: AutoSupport OnDemand is enabled by default and functional when configured to send messages to technical support using HTTPS transport protocol.

.About this task

For clusters that were created prior to ONTAP 9.16.1 and then upgraded to 9.16.1 or later:

* If automatic updates functionality is already enabled, the system component update defaults are not changed after an upgrade.

* If automatic updates are not already enabled, the system component update defaults in ONTAP 9.16.1 and later will be applied.

Automatic system component update defaults are set to either update automatically or show notifications, depending on your ONTAP version. Confirm these settings are correct for your environment before completing the procedure. 

This https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoABILT85hQ[video^] shows a quick overview of using the automatic update process.
