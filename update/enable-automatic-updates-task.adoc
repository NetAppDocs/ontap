.Before you begin

* You must have a current support entitlement. This can be validated on the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/[NetApp support site^] in the *System Details* page.

* To enable automatic updates, you must first enable AutoSupport with HTTPS. If AutoSupport is not enabled on your cluster, or if AutoSupport is enabled on your cluster with another transport protocol, you will be given the option to enable it with HTTPS during this procedure.

NOTE: AutoSupport OnDemand is enabled by default and functional when configured to send messages to technical support using HTTPS transport protocol.

.About this task

Depending on your version of ONTAP, the default settings on the *Enable automatic updates* page for firmware, system, or security files will be set to either update automatically or show notifications. Be sure to confirm that these settings are correct for your environment before completing the appropriate version-specific procedure.
