.Before you begin

* You must have a current support entitlement. You can check this on the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/[NetApp support site^] in the *System Details* page.

* To enable automatic updates, you must first enable AutoSupport with HTTPS. If AutoSupport is not enabled on your cluster, or if AutoSupport is enabled on your cluster with another transport protocol, you can enable it with HTTPS during this procedure.

NOTE: AutoSupport OnDemand is enabled by default and functional when configured to send messages to technical support using HTTPS transport protocol.

.About this task

The default settings on the *Enable automatic updates* page will either update automatically or show notifications, depending on your ONTAP version. Confirm these settings are correct for your environment before completing the procedure.
