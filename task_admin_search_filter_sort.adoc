You can search for various actions and objects in System Manager.  You can also search table data for specific entries.


// BURT 1333777, 8 OCT 2020, thomi, Added table grid search for 9.8, called Cross-Field Search in Functional Spec
System Manager provides two types of searching:

* <<Global searching>>
+
When you enter a search argument in the field at the top of each page, System Manager searches throughout the interface to find matches.  You can then sort and filter the results.

* <<Table-grid searching>>
+
Starting with ONTAP 9.8, when you enter a search argument in the field at the top of a table grid, System Manager searches only the columns and rows of that table to find matches.

== Global searching

At the top of each page in System Manager, you can use a global search field to search various objects and actions in the interface. For example, you can search for different objects by name, pages available in the navigator column (on the left side), various action items, like "Add Volume" or "Add License", and links to external help topics. You can also filter and sort the results.

//Updated for GitHub Issue 91, June 17, aherbin
NOTE: For better results, perform searching, filtering, and sorting one minute after logging in and five minutes after creating, modifying, or deleting an object.

=== Getting search results

The search is not case-sensitive.   You can enter a variety of text strings to find the page, actions, or topics you need.  Up to 20 results are listed.  If more results are found, you can click *Show more* to view all results.   The following examples describe typical searches:

[cols=3,options="header"]
|===
| Type of search
| Sample search string
| Sample search results
| By object name
| vol_
| vol_lun_dest on storage VM: svm0 (Volume)
/vol/vol…est1/lun on storage VM: svm0 (LUN)
svm0:vol_lun_dest1 role: Destination (Relationship)
| By location in interface
| volume
| Add Volume (Action)
Protection – Overview (Page)
Recover deleted volume (Help)
| By actions
| add
| Add Volume (Action)
Network – Overview (Page)
Expand volumes and LUNs (Help)
| By help content
| san
| Storage – Overview (Page)
SAN overview (Help)
Provision SAN storage for databases (Help)
|===

=== Filtering search results

You can narrow the results with filters, as shown in the following examples:

[cols=3,options="header"]
|===
| Filter
| Syntax
| Sample search string
| By object type
| <type>:<objectName>
| volume:vol_2
| By object size
| <type><size-symbol><number><units>
| luns<500mb
| By broken disks
| “broken disk”  or  “unhealthy disk”
| unhealthy disk
| By network interface
| <IP address>
| 172.22.108.21
|===

=== Sorting search results

When you view all the search results, they are sorted alphabetically.  You can sort the results by clicking image:icon_filter.gif[filtering menu] and selecting how you want to sort the results.

== Table-grid searching

Starting with ONTAP 9.8, whenever System Manager displays information in a table-grid format, a search button appears at the top of the table.

When you click *Search*, a text field appears in which you can enter a search argument.  System Manager searches the entire table and displays only the rows that contain text that matches your search argument.

You can use an asterisk ( * ) as a "wildcard" character as a substitute for characters.  For example, searching for `vol*` might provide rows that contain the following:

* vol_122_D9
* vol_lun_dest1
* vol2866
* volspec1
* volum_dest_765
* volume
* volume_new4
* volume9987
