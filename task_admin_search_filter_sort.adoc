You can search for various actions, objects, and information topics in System Manager.  You can also search table data for specific entries.

System Manager provides two types of searching:

* <<Global searching>>
+
When you enter a search argument in the field at the top of each page, System Manager searches throughout the interface to find matches.  You can then sort and filter the results.
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, System Manager also provides search results from the NetApp Support Site to provide links to relevant support information.

* <<Table-grid searching>>
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, when you enter a search argument in the field at the top of a table grid, System Manager searches only the columns and rows of that table to find matches.

== Global searching

At the top of each page in System Manager, you can use a global search field to search various objects and actions in the interface. For example, you can search for different objects by name, pages available in the navigator column (on the left side), various action items, like "Add Volume" or "Add License", and links to external help topics. You can also filter and sort the results.

// 2022 Jun 17, GitHub issue 91
NOTE: For better results, perform searching, filtering, and sorting one minute after logging in and five minutes after creating, modifying, or deleting an object.

=== Getting search results

The search is not case-sensitive.   You can enter a variety of text strings to find the page, actions, or information topics you need.  Up to 20 results are listed.  If more results are found, you can click *Show more* to view all results.   The following examples describe typical searches:

|===

h| Type of search h| Sample search string h| Sample search results

| By object name
| vol_
| vol_lun_dest on storage VM: svm0 (Volume)
/vol/vol…est1/lun on storage VM: svm0 (LUN)

=== Global search results from NetApp Support Site

Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, for users who are registered with Active IQ Digital Advisor (also known as Digital Advisor), System Manager displays another column of results that provide links to NetApp Support Site information, including System Manager product information.  

Search results contain the following information:

* *Title* of the information which is a link to the document in HTML, PDF, EPUB, or other format.
* *Content type*, which identifies whether it is a product documentation topic, a KnowledgeBase article, or another type of information.
* *Summary description* of the content.
* *Created* date when it was first published.
* *Updated* date when it was last updated.

You can perform the following actions:

[cols="35,65"]

=== Filtering search results

You can narrow the results with filters, as shown in the following examples:

|===

h| Filter h| Syntax h| Sample search string

| By object type
| <type>:<objectName>
| volume:vol_2
| By object size
| <type><size-symbol><number><units>
| luns<500mb
| By broken disks
| “broken disk”  or  “unhealthy disk”
| unhealthy disk
| By network interface
| <IP address>
| 172.22.108.21
|===

=== Sorting search results

When you view all the search results, they are sorted alphabetically.  You can sort the results by clicking image:icon_filter.png[Filter icon] and selecting how you want to sort the results.

== Table-grid searching

Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, whenever System Manager displays information in a table-grid format, a search button appears at the top of the table.

When you click *Search*, a text field appears in which you can enter a search argument.  System Manager searches the entire table and displays only the rows that contain text that matches your search argument.

You can use an asterisk ( * ) as a "wildcard" character as a substitute for characters.  For example, searching for `vol*` might provide rows that contain the following:

* vol_122_D9
* vol_lun_dest1
* vol2866
* volspec1
* volum_dest_765
* volume
* volume_new4
* volume9987
