Add quotas to limit the amount of disk space the quota target can use.

You can set a hard limit and a soft limit for a quota.

Hard quotas impose a hard limit on system resources; any operation that would result in exceeding the limit fails. Soft quotas send a warning message when resource usage reaches a certain level, but they do not affect data access operations, so you can take appropriate action before the quota is exceeded.

.Steps

. Click *Storage > Quotas*.
. Click *Add*.
