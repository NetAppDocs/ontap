Using System Manager, you can increase the size of your volume or LUN so that more space is available to your host. The size of a LUN cannot exceed the size of the containing volume.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, when you enter the new capacity for a volume, the *Resize Volume* window displays the impact that resizing the volume will have on data space and snapshot reserve.
