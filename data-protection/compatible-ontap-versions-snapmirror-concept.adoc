[.lead]
You should verify that the source and destination volumes are running compatible ONTAP versions before creating a SnapMirror data protection relationship.

[NOTE]
====
Version-independence is not supported for SVM replication.
====

== Unified replication relationships

For SnapMirror relationships of type "`XDP`", using on premises or Cloud Volumes ONTAP releases:

[NOTE]
====
Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.0:

* ONTAP 9.x.0 releases are cloud-only releases and support Cloud Volumes ONTAP (CVO) systems. The asterisk (*) after the release version indicates a cloud-only release.
* ONTAP 9.x.1 releases are general releases and support both on-premises and CVO systems.

====

[NOTE]
====
Locate the higher, more recent ONTAP version in the left column, and in the top row locate the lower ONTAP version to determine interoperability. Interoperability is bidirectional.

== SnapMirror DR relationships

For SnapMirror relationships of type "`DP`" and policy type "`async-mirror`":
[NOTE]
====
DP-type mirrors cannot be initialized beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1 and are completely deprecated in ONTAP 9.12.1. For more information, see link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/info/communications/ECMLP2880221.html[Deprecation of data protection SnapMirror relationships^].

[NOTE]

In the following table, the column on the left indicates the ONTAP version on the source volume, and the top row indicates the ONTAP versions you can have on your destination volume.

== SnapMirror SVM DR relationships

* For SVM DR data and SVM protection:
+
SVM DR is only supported between clusters running the same version of ONTAP.

* For SVM DR for SVM migration:
+
** Replication is supported in a single direction from an earlier version of ONTAP to a later version of ONTAP; for example, from ONTAP 9.11.1 to ONTAP 9.12.1.
** The ONTAP version on the target cluster must be no more than 2 versions newer, as shown in the table below.
** Replication is not supported for long-term data protection use cases.
