[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can use System Manager to resynchronize the data and configuration details from the source storage VM to the destination storage VM in a broken protection relationship and reestablish the relationship.

ONTAP 9.11.1 introduces an option to bypass a full data warehouse rebuild when you perform a disaster recovery rehearsal, enabling you to return to production faster.

You perform the resync operation only from the destination of the original relationship. The resync deletes any data in the destination storage VM that is newer than the data in the source storage VM.

.Steps
You can use System Manager or the ONTAP CLI to perform this task.

. Under *Relationships*, monitor the resynchronization progress by viewing *Transfer Status* for the relationship.
