You can use SnapMirror to create a data protection relationship between SVMs. In this type of data protection relationship, all or part of the SVM's configuration, from NFS exports and SMB shares to RBAC, is replicated, as well as the data in the volumes that the SVM owns.

== Supported relationship types

Only data-serving SVMs can be replicated. The following data protection relationship types are supported:

* _SnapMirror DR,_ in which the destination typically contains only the Snapshot copies currently on the source.
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, this behavior changes when you are using the mirror-vault policy. Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, you can create different Snapshot policies on the source and destination, and the Snapshot copies on the destination are not overwritten by Snapshot copies on the source:

 ** They are not overwritten from the source to the destination during normal scheduled operations, updates and resync
 ** They are not deleted during break operations.
 ** They are not deleted during flip-resync operations.
When you configure an SVM disaster relationship using the mirror-vault policy using ONTAP 9.9.1 and later, the policy behaves as follows:
 ** User-defined Snapshot copy policies at the source are not copied to the destination.
 ** System-defined Snapshot copy policies are not copied to the destination.
 ** Volume association with user and system defined Snapshot policies are not copied to the destination.
 +
SVM.

* Beginning with ONTAP 9.2, _SnapMirror unified replication,_ in which the destination is configured for both DR and long-term retention.

For more information about SnapMirror unified replication, see link:snapmirror-unified-replication-concept.html[SnapMirror unified replication basics].

The _policy type_ of the replication policy determines the type of relationship it supports. The following table shows the available policy types.

== XDP replaces DP as the SVM replication default in ONTAP 9.4

Beginning with ONTAP 9.4, SVM data protection relationships default to XDP mode. SVM data protection relationships continue to default to DP mode in ONTAP 9.3 and earlier.

Existing relationships are not affected by the new default. If a relationship is already of type DP, it will continue to be of type DP. The following table shows the behavior you can expect.

[NOTE]
====
Version-independence is not supported for SVM replication. In an SVM disaster recovery configuration, the destination SVM must be on a cluster running the same ONTAP version as the source SVM cluster to support failover and fail back operations.
====

link:compatible-ontap-versions-snapmirror-concept.html[Compatible ONTAP versions for SnapMirror relationships]

== How SVM configurations are replicated

The content of an SVM replication relationship is determined by the interaction of the following fields:

* The `-identity-preserve true` option of the `snapmirror create` command replicates the entire SVM configuration.
+
The `-identity-preserve false` option replicates only the volumes and authentication and authorization configurations of the SVM, and the protocol and name service settings listed in link:snapmirror-svm-replication-concept.html#configurations-replicated-in-svm-disaster-recovery-relationships[Configurations replicated in SVM disaster recovery relationships].

* The `-discard-configs network` option of the `snapmirror policy create` command excludes LIFs and related network settings from SVM replication, for use in cases where the source and destination SVMs are in different subnets.
* The `-vserver-dr-protection unprotected` option of the `volume modify` command excludes the specified volume from SVM replication.

Otherwise, SVM replication is almost identical to volume replication. You can use virtually the same workflow for SVM replication as you use for volume replication.

== Support details

The following table shows support details for SnapMirror SVM replication.

[cols="2*"]
|===

h| Resource or feature h| Support details

a|
Deployment types
a|

* Single source to single destination
* Beginning with ONTAP 9.4, fan-out. You can fan-out to two destinations only.
+
By default, only one -identity-preserve true relationship is allowed per source SVM.

a|
Relationship types
a|

* SnapMirror disaster recovery
* Beginning with ONTAP 9.2, SnapMirror unified replication

a|
Replication scope
a|
Intercluster only. You cannot replicate SVMs in the same cluster.

a|
Autonomous Ransomware Protection
a|

* Supported beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1. For more information, see link:../anti-ransomware/index.html[Autonomous Ransomware Protection].

a|
Consistency groups asynchronous support
a|
Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, a maximum of 32 SVM disaster recovery relationships are supported when consistency groups exist. See link:../consistency-groups/protect-task.html[Protect a consistency group] and link:../consistency-groups/limits.html[Consistency group limits] for more information.

a|
FabricPool
a|
Beginning with ONTAP 9.6, SnapMirror SVM replication is supported with FabricPools.
a|
MetroCluster
a|
Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, both sides of a SVM disaster recovery relationship within a MetroCluster configuration can act as a source for additional SVM disaster recovery configurations.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.5, SnapMirror SVM replication is supported on MetroCluster configurations.

* In releases earlier than ONTAP 9.10.X, a MetroCluster configuration cannot be the destination of an SVM disaster recovery relationship.
* In ONTAP 9.10.1 and later releases, a MetroCluster configuration can be the destination of an SVM disaster recovery relationship for migration purposes only, and it must meet all necessary requirements described in https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/83785-tr-4966.pdf[TR-4966: Migrating a SVM into a MetroCluster solution^].
* Only an active SVM within a MetroCluster configuration can be the source of an SVM disaster recovery relationship.
+
A source can be a sync-source SVM before switchover or a sync-destination SVM after switchover.

* When a MetroCluster configuration is in a steady state, the MetroCluster sync-destination SVM cannot be the source of an SVM disaster recovery relationship, since the volumes are not online.
* When the sync-source SVM is the source of an SVM disaster recovery relationship, the source SVM disaster recovery relationship information is replicated to the MetroCluster partner.
* During the switchover and switchback processes, replication to the SVM disaster recovery destination might fail.
+
However, after the switchover or switchback process completes, the next SVM disaster recovery scheduled updates will succeed.

a| Consistency group 
a| Supported beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1. For more information, see xref:../consistency-groups/protect-task.html[Protect a consistency group].

a|
ONTAP S3
a|
Not supported with SVM disaster recovery.

a|
SnapMirror Synchronous
a|
Not supported with SVM disaster recovery.

a|
Version-independence
a|
Not supported.

a|
Volume encryption
a|

* Encrypted volumes on the source are encrypted on the destination.
* Onboard Key Manager or KMIP servers must be configured on the destination.
* New encryption keys are generated at the destination.
* If the destination does not contain a node that supports volume .encryption, replication succeeds, but the destination volumes are not encrypted.
