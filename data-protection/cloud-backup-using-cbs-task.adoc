[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, you can use System Manager to back up data in the cloud using NetApp Backup and Recovery service.

Backup and Recovery supports FlexVol read-write volumes and data-protection (DP) volumes. Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, Backup and Recovery supports FlexGroup volumes and SnapLock volumes.

Learn more about link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/data-services-backup-recovery/index.html[NetApp Backup and Recovery^].

.Before you begin

You should perform the following procedures to establish an account in the NetApp Console. For the service account, you need to create the role as "Account Admin". (Other service account roles do not have the required privileges needed to establish a connection from System Manager.)

. link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html[Create a Console agent in NetApp Console^] with one of the following cloud providers:
+
* Microsoft Azure
* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* StorageGRID (ONTAP 9.10.1)
+
NOTE: Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can select StorageGRID as a cloud backup provider, but only if NetApp Console is deployed on premises.  The Console agent must be installed on premises and available through the NetApp Console software-as-a-service (SaaS) application.

* Cluster must be running ONTAP 9.9.1 or later.

.About this task
You cannot protect new volumes or LUNs on the cloud for the following cluster configurations:

* The cluster cannot be in a MetroCluster environment.
* SVM-DR is not supported.
* FlexGroup volumes cannot be backed up using NetApp Backup and Recovery.

.Steps

. When provisioning a volume or LUN, on the *Protection* page in System Manager, select the checkbox labeled *Enable SnapMirror (Local or Remote)*.

. Select the Backup and Recovery policy type.

. If Backup and Recovery is not enabled, select *Enable Backup using NetApp Backup and Recovery*.

== Protect existing volumes or LUNs on the cloud

You can establish a SnapMirror protection relationship for existing volumes and LUNs.

.Steps

. Select an existing volume or LUN, and select *Protect*.

. On the *Protect Volumes* page, specify *Backup using NetApp Backup and Recovery* for the protection policy.

. Select *Protect*.

. On the *Protection* page, select the checkbox labeled *Enable SnapMirror (Local or Remote)*.

. Select *Connect and enable NetApp Backup and Recovery*.

== Restore data from backup files
You can perform backup management operations, such as restoring data, updating relationships, and deleting relationships, only when using the NetApp Console.
