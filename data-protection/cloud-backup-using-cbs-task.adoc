[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, you can use System Manager to back up data in the cloud using BlueXP backup and recovery service (formerly Cloud Backup service).

BlueXP backup and recovery service supports FlexVol read-write volumes and data-protection (DP) volumes. Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, BlueXP backup and recovery service supports FlexGroup volumes and SnapLock volumes.

Learn more about link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-backup-recovery/index.html[BlueXP backup and recovery^].

.Before you begin

You should perform the following procedures to establish an account in BlueXP. For the service account, you need to create the role as "Account Admin". (Other service account roles do not have the required privileges needed to establish a connection from System Manager.)

. link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/concept_connectors.html[Create a connector in BlueXP^] with one of the following cloud providers:
+
* Microsoft Azure
* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* StorageGRID (ONTAP 9.10.1)
+
NOTE: Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can select StorageGRID as a cloud backup provider, but only if BlueXP is deployed on premises.  The BlueXP Connector must be installed on premises and available through the BlueXP software-as-a-service (SaaS) application.

== Protect new volumes or LUNs on the cloud

When you create a new volume or LUN, you can establish a SnapMirror protection relationship that enables backing up to the cloud for the volume or LUN.

.Before you begin

* You should have a SnapMirror license.
* Intercluster LIFs should be configured.
* NTP should be configured.
* Cluster must be running ONTAP 9.9.1.

.About this task
You cannot protect new volumes or LUNs on the cloud for the following cluster configurations:

* The cluster cannot be in a MetroCluster environment.
* SVM-DR is not supported.
* FlexGroups cannot be backed up using BlueXP backup and recovery.

.Steps

. When provisioning a volume or LUN, on the *Protection* page in System Manager, select the checkbox labeled *Enable SnapMirror (Local or Remote)*.

. Select the BlueXP backup and recovery policy type.

. If the BlueXP backup and recovery service is not enabled, select *Enable Backup using BlueXP backup and recovery service service*.

== Protect existing volumes or LUNs on the cloud

You can establish a SnapMirror protection relationship for existing volumes and LUNs.

.Steps

. Select an existing volume or LUN, and select *Protect*.

. On the *Protect Volumes* page, specify *Backup using BlueXP backup and recovery service* for the protection policy.

. Select *Protect*.

. On the *Protection* page, select the checkbox labeled *Enable SnapMirror (Local or Remote)*.

. Select *Connect and enable BlueXP backup and recovery*.

== Restore data from backup files
You can perform backup management operations, such as restoring data, updating relationships, and deleting relationships, only when using the BlueXP interface. Refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task_restore_backups.html[Restoring data from backup files^] for more information.
