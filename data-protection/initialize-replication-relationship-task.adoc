= Initialize a replication relationship

[.lead]
For all relationship types, initialization performs a _baseline transfer_: it makes a snapshot of the source volume, then transfers that copy and all the data blocks it references to the destination volume. Otherwise, the contents of the transfer depend on the policy.

.What you'll need

The source and destination clusters and SVMs must be peered.

.About this task

Initialization can be time-consuming. You might want to run the baseline transfer in off-peak hours.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.5, SnapMirror synchronous relationships are supported.

.Step

. Initialize a replication relationship:
+
`snapmirror initialize -source-path <SVM:volume>|<cluster://SVM/volume>, ... -destination-path <SVM:volume>|<cluster://SVM/volume>, ...`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
[NOTE]
====
You must run this command from the destination SVM or the destination cluster.
====
+
The following example initializes the relationship between the source volume `volA` on `svm1` and the destination volume `volA_dst` on `svm_backup`:
+
