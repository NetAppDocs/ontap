[.lead]
You might want to exclude network, name service, and other settings from an SVM replication relationship to avoid conflicts or configuration differences with the destination SVM.

You can use the `-identity-preserve false` option of the `snapmirror create` command to replicate only the volumes and security configurations of an SVM. Some protocol and name service settings are also preserved.

.About this task

For a list of preserved protocol and name service settings, see link:snapmirror-svm-replication-concept.html#configurations-replicated-in-svm-disaster-recovery-relationships[Configurations replicated in SVM DR relationships].

For complete command syntax, see the man page.

.Before you begin

The source and destination clusters and SVMs must be peered.

For more information, see link:../peering/create-cluster-relationship-93-later-task.html[Create a cluster peer relationship] and link:../peering/create-intercluster-svm-peer-relationship-93-later-task.html[Create an SVM intercluster peer relationship].

.Steps

. Create a destination SVM:
+
`vserver create -vserver _SVM_ -subtype dp-destination`
+
The SVM name must be unique across the source and destination clusters.
+
The following example creates a destination SVM named `svm_backup`:
+
----
cluster_dst:> vserver create -vserver svm_backup -subtype dp-destination
----

. From the destination cluster, create an SVM peer relationship using the `vserver peer create` command.
+
For more information, see link:../peering/create-intercluster-svm-peer-relationship-93-later-task.html[Create an SVM intercluster peer relationship].

. Create a replication job schedule:
+
`job schedule cron create -name _job_name_ -month _month_ -dayofweek _day_of_week_ -day _day_of_month_ -hour _hour_ -minute _minute_`
+
For `-month`, `-dayofweek`, and `-hour`, you can specify `all` to run the job every month, day of the week, and hour, respectively.
+
[NOTE]
====
The minimum supported schedule (RPO) for FlexVol volumes in an SVM SnapMirror relationship is 15 minutes. The minimum supported schedule (RPO) for FlexGroup volumes in an SVM SnapMirror relationship is 30 minutes.
====
+
The following example creates a job schedule named `my_weekly` that runs on Saturdays at 3:00 a.m.:
+
----
cluster_dst::> job schedule cron create -name my_weekly -dayofweek "Saturday" -hour 3 -minute 0
----

. Create a replication relationship that excludes network, name service, and other configuration settings:
+
`snapmirror create -source-path _SVM_: -destination-path _SVM_: -type DP|XDP -schedule schedule -policy policy -identity-preserve false`
+
[NOTE]
====
You must enter a colon (:) after the SVM name in the `-source-path` and `-destination-path` options. See the examples below.    You must run this command from the destination SVM or the destination cluster.
====
+
The following example creates a SnapMirror DR relationship using the default `MirrorAllSnapshots` policy. The relationship excludes network, name service, and other configuration settings from SVM replication:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror create -source-path svm1: -destination-path svm_backup: -type XDP -schedule my_daily -policy MirrorAllSnapshots -identity-preserve false
----
+
The following example creates a unified replication relationship using the default `MirrorAndVault` policy. The relationship excludes network, name service, and other configuration settings:
+
----
cluster_dst:> snapmirror create svm1: -destination-path svm_backup: -type XDP -schedule my_daily -policy MirrorAndVault -identity-preserve false
----
+
Assuming you have created a custom policy with the policy type `async-mirror`, the following example creates a SnapMirror DR relationship. The relationship excludes network, name service, and other configuration settings from SVM replication:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror create -source-path svm1: -destination-path svm_backup: -type XDP -schedule my_daily -policy my_mirrored -identity-preserve false
----
+
Assuming you have created a custom policy with the policy type `mirror-vault`, the following example creates a unified replication relationship. The relationship excludes network, name service, and other configuration settings from SVM replication:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror create -source-path svm1: -destination-path svm_backup: -type XDP -schedule my_daily -policy my_unified -identity-preserve false
----

. Stop the destination SVM:
+
`vserver stop`
+
`_SVM name_`
+
The following example stops a destination SVM named dvs1:
+
----
destination_cluster::> vserver stop -vserver dvs1
----

. If you are using SMB, you must also configure an SMB server.
+
See link:create-smb-server-task.html[SMB only: Creating an SMB server].

. From the destination SVM or the destination cluster, initialize the SVM replication relationship:
+
`snapmirror initialize -source-path _SVM_name_: -destination-path _SVM_name_:`

.After you finish

You must configure the network and protocols on the destination SVM for data access in the event a disaster occurs.
