You can use the `snapmirror delete` and `snapmirror release` commands to delete a volume replication relationship. You can then delete unneeded destination volumes manually. Learn more about the commands described in this procedure in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/[ONTAP command reference^].

.About this task

The `snapmirror release` command deletes any SnapMirror-created snapshots from the source. You can use the `-relationship-info-only` option to preserve the snapshots.

.Steps

. Quiesce the replication relationship:
+
`snapmirror quiesce -destination-path <SVM:volume>|<cluster://SVM/volume>`
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror quiesce -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst
----
+
Learn more about `snapmirror quiesce` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/snapmirror-quiesce.html[ONTAP command reference^].
. (Optional) Break the replication relationship if you require the destination volume to be a read/write volume. You can skip this step if you plan to delete the destination volume or if you don't need the volume to be read/write:
+
`snapmirror break -source-path <SVM:volume>|<cluster://SVM/volume>, …​ -destination-path <SVM:volume>|<cluster://SVM/volume>, …​`
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror break -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst
----

. Delete the replication relationship:
+
`snapmirror delete -source-path <SVM:volume>|<cluster://SVM/volume>, ... -destination-path <SVM:volume>|<cluster://SVM/volume>, ...`
+
[NOTE]
====
You must run this command from the destination cluster or destination SVM.
====
+
The following example deletes the relationship between the source volume `volA` on `svm1` and the destination volume `volA_dst` on `svm_backup`:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror delete -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst
----
+
Learn more about `snapmirror delete` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/snapmirror-delete.html[ONTAP command reference^].
. Release replication relationship information from the source SVM:
+
`snapmirror release -source-path <SVM:volume>|<cluster://SVM/volume>, ... -destination-path <SVM:volume>|<cluster://SVM/volume>, ...`
+
[NOTE]
====
You must run this command from the source cluster or source SVM.
====
+
The following example releases information for the specified replication relationship from the source SVM `svm1`:
+
----
cluster_src::> snapmirror release -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst
