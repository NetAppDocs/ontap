By default, all RW data volumes of the source SVM are replicated. If you do not want to protect all the volumes on the source SVM, you can use the `-vserver-dr-protection unprotected` option of the `volume modify` command to exclude volumes from SVM replication.

.Steps

. Exclude a volume from SVM replication:
+
`volume modify -vserver _SVM_ -volume _volume_ -vserver-dr-protection unprotected`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
The following example excludes the volume `volA_src` from SVM replication:
+
----
cluster_src::> volume modify -vserver SVM1 -volume volA_src -vserver-dr-protection unprotected
----
+
If you later want to include a volume in the SVM replication that you originally excluded, run the following command:
+
`volume modify -vserver _SVM_ -volume _volume_ -vserver-dr-protection protected`
+
The following example includes the volume `volA_src` in the SVM replication:
+
----
cluster_src::> volume modify -vserver SVM1 -volume volA_src -vserver-dr-protection protected
----

. Create and initialize the SVM replication relationship as described in link:replicate-entire-svm-config-task.html[Replicating an entire SVM configuration].
