The _snapshot reserve_ sets aside a percentage of disk space for snapshots, five percent by default. Because snapshots use space in the active file system when the snapshot reserve is exhausted, you might want to increase the snapshot reserve as needed. Alternatively, you can autodelete snapshots when the reserve is full.
