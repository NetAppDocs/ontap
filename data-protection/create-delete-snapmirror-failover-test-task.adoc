[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can use System Manager to create a volume clone to test SnapMirror failover and disaster recovery without disrupting the active SnapMIrror relationship. When you finish testing, you can clean up the associated data and delete the test volume.

== Create a SnapMirror failover test volume

.About this task

* You can perform failover tests on synchronous and SnapMirror asynchronous relationships.
* A volume clone is created to perform the disaster recovery test.
* The clone volume is created on the same storage VM as the SnapMirror destination.
* You can use FlexVol and FlexGroup SnapMirror relationships.
* If a test clone already exists for the selected relationship, you cannot create another clone for that relationship.
* SnapLock vault relationships are not supported.

.Before you begin

* You must be a cluster administrator.
* The SnapMirror license must be installed on the source and destination cluster.

.Steps

. On the destination cluster, select *Protection > Relationships*. 
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon] next to the relationship source and choose *Test Failover*.
. In the *Test Failover* window, select *Test Failover*.
. Select *Storage > Volumes*, and verify that the test failover volume is listed.
. Select *Storage > Shares*.
. Select image:icon_add_blue_bg.gif[Add icon] and choose *Share*.
. In the *Add share* window, type a name for the share in the *Share Name* field.
. In the *Folder* field, select *Browse*, select the test clone volume, and *Save*. 
. At the bottom of the *Add share* window, choose *Save*.
. In the *Storage > Shares* pane, locate the share you created and select image:icon_dropdown_arrow.gif[Dropdown icon] to view the share information.
. Under *SMB/CIFS Access*, copy or make note of the access path for the share; for example, \\123.456.7.890\failover_test.
. Use the SMB access path to open the share on the client and verify that the test volume has read and write capabilities. 

== Clean up failover data and delete the test volume

After you have completed failover testing, you can clean up all data associated with the test volume and delete it.

.Steps

. On the destination cluster, select *Protection > Relationships*. 
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon] next to the relationship source and choose *Clean Up Test Failover*.
. In the *Clean Up Test Failover* window, select *Clean Up*.
. Select *Storage > Volumes* and verify that the test volume was deleted.
