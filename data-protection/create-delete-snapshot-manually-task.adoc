You can create Snapshot copies manually when you can't wait for a scheduled snapshot to be created, and you can delete Snapshot copies when they are no longer needed.

.About this task

This procedure applies to FAS, AFF, and current ASA systems. If you have an ASA r2 system (ASA A1K, ASA A70, or ASA A90), follow link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/asa-r2/data-protection/create-snapshots.html#step-2-create-a-snapshot[these steps^] to create an on-demand snapshot. ASA r2 systems provide a simplified ONTAP experience specific to SAN-only customers.
