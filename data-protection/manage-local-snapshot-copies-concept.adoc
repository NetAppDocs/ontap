A _snapshot_ is a read-only, point-in-time image of a volume. The image consumes minimal storage space and incurs negligible performance overhead because it records only changes to files since the last snapshot.

You can use a snapshot to restore the entire contents of a volume, or to recover individual files or LUNs. snapshots are stored in the directory `.snapshot` on the volume.

In ONTAP 9.4 and later, a FlexVol volume can contain up to 1023 snapshots.
In ONTAP 9.3 and earlier, a volume can contain up to 255 snapshots. 

[NOTE]
====
Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, FlexGroup volumes can contain 1023 snapshots. For more information, see link:../flexgroup/protect-snapshot-copies-task.html[Protect FlexGroup volumes using snapshots].
