[.lead]
The relationship between the source volume in primary storage and the destination volume in secondary storage is called a _data protection relationship._ You can use the `snapmirror create` command to create SnapMirror DR, SnapVault, or unified replication data protection relationships. 

[NOTE]
This procedure applies to FAS, AFF, and current ASA systems. If you have an ASA r2 system (ASA A1K, ASA A90, ASA A70, ASA A50, ASA A30, ASA A20, or ASA C30), follow link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/asa-r2/data-protection/snapshot-replication.html[these steps^] to create a replication relationship. ASA r2 systems provide a simplified ONTAP experience specific to SAN-only customers.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, you can use System Manager to select pre-created and custom mirror and vault policies, to display and select legacy policies, and to override the transfer schedules defined in a protection policy when protecting volumes and storage VMs. This capability is also available in ONTAP 9.8P12 and later patches of ONTAP 9.8.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using ONTAP 9.8P12 or later ONTAP 9.8 patch release and you configured SnapMirror using System Manager, you should use ONTAP 9.9.1P13 or later and ONTAP 9.10.1P10 or later patch releases if you plan to upgrade to ONTAP 9.9.1 or ONTAP 9.10.1 releases.

.Before you begin

* The source and destination clusters and SVMs must be peered.
+
link:../peering/index.html[Cluster and SVM peering]

* The language on the destination volume must be the same as the language on the source volume.

.About this task

Until ONTAP 9.3, SnapMirror invoked in DP mode and SnapMirror invoked in XDP mode used different replication engines, with different approaches to version-dependence:

* SnapMirror invoked in DP mode used a _version-dependent_ replication engine in which the ONTAP version was required to be the same on primary and secondary storage:
+
----
cluster_dst::>  snapmirror create -type DP -source-path ... -destination-path ...
----

* SnapMirror invoked in XDP mode used a _version-flexible_ replication engine that supported different ONTAP versions on primary and secondary storage:
+
----
cluster_dst::>  snapmirror create -type XDP -source-path ... -destination-path ...
----

With improvements in performance, the significant benefits of version-flexible SnapMirror outweigh the slight advantage in replication throughput obtained with version-dependent mode. For this reason, beginning with ONTAP 9.3, XDP mode has been made the new default, and any invocations of DP mode on the command line or in new or existing scripts are automatically converted to XDP mode.

Existing relationships are not affected. If a relationship is already of type DP, it will continue to be of type DP. The table below shows the behavior you can expect.

[cols="25,25,50"]
|===

h| If you specify... h| The type is... h| The default policy (if you do not specify a policy) is...

a|
DP
a|
XDP
a|
MirrorAllSnapshots (SnapMirror DR)
a|
Nothing
a|
XDP
a|
MirrorAllSnapshots (SnapMirror DR)
a|
XDP
a|
XDP
a|
XDPDefault (SnapVault)
|===

See also the examples in the procedure below.

The only exceptions to conversion are as follows:

* SVM data protection relationships continue to default to DP mode.
+
Specify XDP explicitly to obtain XDP mode with the default `MirrorAllSnapshots` policy.

* Load-sharing data protection relationships continue to default to DP mode.
* SnapLock data protection relationships continue to default to DP mode.
* Explicit invocations of DP continue to default to DP mode if you set the following cluster-wide option:
+
----
options replication.create_data_protection_rels.enable on
----
+
This option is ignored if you do not explicitly invoke DP.

In ONTAP 9.3 and earlier, a destination volume can contain up to 251 snapshots. In ONTAP 9.4 and later, a destination volume can contain up to 1019 snapshots.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.5, SnapMirror synchronous relationships are supported.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, the `-backoff-level` option is added to the `snapmirror create`, `snapmirror modify`, and `snapmirror restore` commands to enable you to specify the backoff level per relationship. The option is supported only with FlexVol SnapMirror relationships. The optional command specifies the SnapMirror backoff level due to client ops. Backoff values can be high, medium or none. The default value is high. 

Learn more about `snapmirror create`, `snapmirror modify`, and `snapmirror restore` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/search.html?q=snapmirror[ONTAP command reference^].

.Steps

You can use System Manager or the ONTAP CLI to create a replication relationship.

[role="tabbed-block"]
====
.System Manager
--

. Select the volume or LUN to protect: click *Storage > Volumes* or *Storage > LUNs*, and then click the desired volume or LUN name.

. Click image:icon_protect.gif[Protect icon].

. Select the destination cluster and storage VM.

. The asynchronous policy is selected by default. To select a synchronous policy, click *More Options*.

. Click *Protect*.

. Click the *SnapMirror (Local or Remote)* tab for the selected volume or LUN to verify that protection is set up correctly.

.CLI

. From the destination cluster, create a replication relationship:

You must replace the variables in angle brackets with the required values before running this command.
+
[source, cli]
----
snapmirror create -source-path <SVM:volume> -destination-path <SVM:volume> -type <DP|XDP> -schedule <schedule> -policy <policy>
----
+
[NOTE]
The `schedule` parameter is not applicable when creating SnapMirror synchronous relationships.
+
The following example creates a SnapMirror DR relationship using the default `MirrorLatest` policy:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror create -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst -type XDP -schedule my_daily -policy MirrorLatest
----
+
The following example creates a SnapVault relationship using the default `XDPDefault` policy:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror create -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst -type XDP -schedule my_daily -policy XDPDefault
----
+
The following example creates a unified replication relationship using the default `MirrorAndVault` policy:
+
----
cluster_dst:> snapmirror create -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst -type XDP -schedule my_daily -policy MirrorAndVault
----
+
The following example creates a unified replication relationship using the custom `my_unified` policy:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror create -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst -type XDP -schedule my_daily -policy my_unified
----
+
The following example creates a SnapMirror synchronous relationship using the default `Sync` policy:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror create -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst -type XDP -policy Sync
----
+
The following example creates a SnapMirror synchronous relationship using the default `StrictSync` policy:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror create -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst -type XDP -policy StrictSync
----
+
The following example creates a SnapMirror DR relationship. With the DP type automatically converted to XDP and with no policy specified, the policy defaults to the `MirrorAllSnapshots` policy:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror create -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst -type DP -schedule my_daily
----
+
The following example creates a SnapMirror DR relationship. With no type or policy specified, the policy defaults to the `MirrorAllSnapshots` policy:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror create -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst -schedule my_daily
----
+
The following example creates a SnapMirror DR relationship. With no policy specified, the policy defaults to the `XDPDefault` policy:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror create -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst -type XDP -schedule my_daily
----
+
The following example creates a SnapMirror synchronous relationship with the predefined policy `SnapCenterSync`:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror create -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst -type XDP -policy SnapCenterSync
----
+
[NOTE]
The predefined policy `SnapCenterSync` is of type `Sync`. This policy replicates any snapshot that is created with the `snapmirror-label` of "app_consistent".

.After you finish

Use the `snapmirror show` command to verify that the SnapMirror relationship was created.
Learn more about `snapmirror show` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/snapmirror-show.html[ONTAP command reference^].
