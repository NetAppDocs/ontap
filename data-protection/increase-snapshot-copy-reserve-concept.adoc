In deciding whether to increase the snapshot reserve, it's important to remember that a snapshot records only changes to files since the last snapshot was made. It consumes disk space only when blocks in the active file system are modified or deleted.

This means that the rate of change of the file system is the key factor in determining the amount of disk space used by snapshots. No matter how many snapshots you create, they will not consume disk space if the active file system has not changed.

A FlexVol volume containing database transaction logs, for example, might have a snapshot reserve as large as 20% to account for its greater rate of change. Not only will you want to create more snapshots to capture the more frequent updates to the database, you will also want to have a larger snapshot reserve to handle the additional disk space the snapshots consume.

[TIP]
====
A snapshot consists of pointers to blocks rather than copies of blocks. You can think of a pointer as a "`claim`" on a block: ONTAP "`holds`" the block until the snapshot is deleted.
