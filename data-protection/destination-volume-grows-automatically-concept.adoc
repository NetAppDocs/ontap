During a data protection mirror transfer, the destination volume grows automatically in size if the source volume has grown, provided there is available space in the aggregate that contains the volume.

This behavior occurs irrespective of any automatic growth setting on the destination. You cannot limit the volume's growth or prevent ONTAP from growing it.

By default, data protection volumes are set to the `grow_shrink` autosize mode, which enables the volume to grow or shrink in response to the amount of used space. The max-autosize for data protection volumes is equal to the maximum FlexVol size and is platform dependent. For example:

* FAS8200, default DP volume max-autosize = 100TB
