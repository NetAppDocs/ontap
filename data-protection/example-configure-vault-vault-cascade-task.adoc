[.lead]
An example will show in concrete terms how you can configure replication relationships one step at a time. You can use the vault-vault cascade deployment configured in the example to retain more than 251 snapshots labeled `my-weekly`.

.Before you begin

* The source and destination clusters and SVMs must be peered.
* You must be running ONTAP 9.2 or later. Vault-vault cascades are not supported in earlier ONTAP releases.

.About this task

The example assumes the following:

* You have configured snapshots on the source cluster with the SnapMirror labels `my-daily`, `my-weekly`, and `my-monthly`.
* You have configured destination volumes named `volA` on the secondary and tertiary destination clusters.
* You have configured replication job schedules named `my_snapvault` on the secondary and tertiary destination clusters.

The example shows how to create replication relationships based on two custom policies:

* The `snapvault_secondary` policy retains 7 daily, 52 weekly, and 180 monthly snapshots on the secondary destination cluster.
* The `snapvault_tertiary policy` retains 250 weekly snapshots on the tertiary destination cluster.

.Steps

. On the secondary destination cluster, create the `snapvault_secondary` policy:
+
`cluster_secondary::> snapmirror policy create -policy snapvault_secondary -type vault -comment "Policy on secondary for vault to vault cascade" -vserver svm_secondary`
. On the secondary destination cluster, define the `my-daily` rule for the policy:
+
`cluster_secondary::> snapmirror policy add-rule -policy snapvault_secondary -snapmirror-label my-daily -keep 7 -vserver svm_secondary`
. On the secondary destination cluster, define the `my-weekly` rule for the policy:
+
`cluster_secondary::> snapmirror policy add-rule -policy snapvault_secondary -snapmirror-label my-weekly -keep 52 -vserver svm_secondary`
. On the secondary destination cluster, define the `my-monthly` rule for the policy:
+
`cluster_secondary::> snapmirror policy add-rule -policy snapvault_secondary -snapmirror-label my-monthly -keep 180 -vserver svm_secondary`
. On the secondary destination cluster, verify the policy:
+
`cluster_secondary::> snapmirror policy show snapvault_secondary -instance`
+

. On the secondary destination cluster, create the relationship with the source cluster:
+
`cluster_secondary::> snapmirror create -source-path svm_primary:volA -destination-path svm_secondary:volA -type XDP -schedule my_snapvault -policy snapvault_secondary`
. On the secondary destination cluster, initialize the relationship with the source cluster:
+
`cluster_secondary::> snapmirror initialize -source-path svm_primary:volA -destination-path svm_secondary:volA`
. On the tertiary destination cluster, create the `snapvault_tertiary` policy:
+
`cluster_tertiary::> snapmirror policy create -policy snapvault_tertiary -type vault -comment "Policy on tertiary for vault to vault cascade" -vserver svm_tertiary`
. On the tertiary destination cluster, define the `my-weekly` rule for the policy:
+
`cluster_tertiary::> snapmirror policy add-rule -policy snapvault_tertiary -snapmirror-label my-weekly -keep 250 -vserver svm_tertiary`
. On the tertiary destination cluster, verify the policy:
+
`cluster_tertiary::> snapmirror policy show snapvault_tertiary -instance`
