The job schedule determines when SnapMirror automatically updates the data protection relationship to which the schedule is assigned. You can use System Manager or the `job schedule cron create` command to create a replication job schedule. 

.About this task

You assign a job schedule when you create a data protection relationship. If you do not assign a job schedule, you must update the relationship manually.

.Steps
You can create a replication job schedule using System Manager or the ONTAP CLI.

[source,cli]
----
job schedule cron create -name <job_name> -month <month> -dayofweek <day_of_week> -day <day_of_month> -hour <hour> -minute <minute>
----
+
For `-month`, `-dayofweek`, and `-hour`, you can specify `all` to run the job every month, day of the week, and hour, respectively.
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can include the Vserver for your job schedule:
+
job schedule cron create -name <job_name> -vserver <Vserver_name> -month <month> -dayofweek <day_of_week> -day <day_of_month> -hour <hour> -minute <minute>

[NOTE]
===
The minimum supported schedule (RPO) for FlexVol volumes in a volume SnapMirror relationship is 5 minutes. The minimum supported schedule (RPO) for FlexGroup volumes in a volume SnapMirror relationship is 30 minutes.

The following example creates a job schedule named `my_weekly` that runs on Saturdays at 3:00 a.m.:

----
cluster_dst::> job schedule cron create -name my_weekly -dayofweek "Saturday" -hour 3 -minute 0
