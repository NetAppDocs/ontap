You should be aware of basic SnapMirror limitations before creating a data protection relationship.

* A destination volume can have only one source volume.
+
[NOTE]
A source volume can have multiple destination volumes. The destination volume can be the source volume for any type of SnapMirror replication relationship.

* Depending on the array model, you can fan out a maximum of eight or sixteen destination volumes from a single source volume. See the link:https://hwu.netapp.com/[Hardware Universe^] to learn details for your specific configuration.
* You cannot restore files to the destination of a SnapMirror DR relationship.
* Source or destination SnapVault volumes cannot be 32-bit.
* The source volume for a SnapVault relationship should not be a FlexClone volume.
+
[NOTE]
The relationship will work, but the efficiency offered by FlexClone volumes will not be preserved.
