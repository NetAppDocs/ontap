= Make the destination volume writeable

[.lead]
You need to make the destination volume writeable before you can serve data from the volume to clients. You can use the `snapmirror quiesce` command to stop scheduled transfers to the destination, the `snapmirror abort` command to stop ongoing transfers, and the `snapmirror break` command to make the destination writeable.

.About this task

You must perform this task from the destination SVM or the destination cluster.

.Steps

. Stop scheduled transfers to the destination:
+
`snapmirror quiesce -source-path _SVM:volume|cluster://SVM/volume_, ... -destination-path _SVM:volume|cluster://SVM/volume_, ...`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
The following example stops scheduled transfers between the source volume `volA` on `svm1` and the destination volume `volA_dst` on `svm_backup`:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror quiesce -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst
----

. Stop ongoing transfers to the destination:
+
`snapmirror abort -source-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_, ... -destination-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_, ...`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
[NOTE]
====
This step is not required for SnapMirror Synchronous relationships (supported starting with ONTAP 9.5).
====
+
The following example stops ongoing transfers between the source volume `volA` on `svm1` and the destination volume `volA_dst` on `svm_backup`:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror abort -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst
----

. Break the SnapMirror DR relationship:
+
`snapmirror break -source-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_, ... -destination-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_, ...`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
The following example breaks the relationship between the source volume `volA` on `svm1` and the destination volume `volA_dst` on `svm_backup` and the destination volume `volA_dst` on `svm_backup`:

cluster_dst::> snapmirror break -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst
