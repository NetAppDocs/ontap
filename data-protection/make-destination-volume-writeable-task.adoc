= Make the destination volume writeable with ONTAP
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

[.lead]
You need to make the destination volume writeable before you can serve data from the volume to clients. To serve data from a mirror destination when a source becomes unavailable, stop scheduled transfers to the destination, and then break the SnapMirror relationship to make the destination writable.

.About this task

You must perform this task from the destination SVM or the destination cluster.

.Steps
You can use System Manager or the ONTAP CLI to make a destination volume writable.

.System Manager
--

. Select the protection relationship: click *Protection > Relationships*, and then click the desired volume name.

. Click image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon].

. Stop scheduled transfers : click *Pause*.

. Make the destination writable: click *Break*.

. Go to the main *Relationships* page to verify that the relationship state displays as "broken off".

.Next steps
You need to link:resynchronize-relationship-task.html[reverse resynchronize the replication relationship] after you make a destination volume writeable. 

When the disabled source volume is available again, you should reverse resynchronize the relationship again to copy the current data to the original source volume.

. Stop scheduled transfers to the destination:
+
[source,cli]
----
snapmirror quiesce -source-path <SVM:volume|cluster://SVM/volume> -destination-path <SVM:volume|cluster://SVM/volume>
----
+
Learn more about `snapmirror quiesce` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/snapmirror-quiesce.html[ONTAP command reference^].
+
The following example stops scheduled transfers between the source volume `volA` on `svm1` and the destination volume `volA_dst` on `svm_backup`:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror quiesce -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst
----

. Stop ongoing transfers to the destination:
+
[source,cli]
----
snapmirror abort -source-path <SVM:volume|cluster://SVM/volume> -destination-path <SVM:volume|cluster://SVM/volume>
----
+
Learn more about `snapmirror abort` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/snapmirror-abort.html[ONTAP command reference^].
+
[NOTE]
This step is not required for SnapMirror synchronous relationships (supported beginning with ONTAP 9.5).
+
The following example stops ongoing transfers between the source volume `volA` on `svm1` and the destination volume `volA_dst` on `svm_backup`:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror abort -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst
----

. Break the SnapMirror DR relationship:
+
[source,cli]
----
snapmirror break -source-path <SVM:volume|cluster://SVM/volume> -destination-path <SVM:volume|cluster://SVM/volume>
----
+
Learn more about `snapmirror break` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/snapmirror-break.html[ONTAP command reference^].
+
The following example breaks the relationship between the source volume `volA` on `svm1` and the destination volume `volA_dst` on `svm_backup`:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror break -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst
