SnapMirror preserves storage efficiency on the source and destination volumes, with one exception, when postprocess data compression is enabled on the destination. In that case, all storage efficiency is lost on the destination. To correct this issue, you need to disable postprocess compression on the destination, update the relationship manually, and re-enable storage efficiency.

.What you'll need

* The source and destination clusters and SVMs must be peered.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-system-manager-classic/peering/index.html[Cluster and SVM peering^]

* You must disable postprocess compression on the destination.

.About this task

You can use the `volume efficiency show` command to determine whether efficiency is enabled on a volume. For more information, see the man pages.

You can check if SnapMirror is maintaining storage efficiency by viewing the SnapMirror audit logs and locating the transfer description. If the transfer description displays `transfer_desc=Logical Transfer`, SnapMirror is not maintaining storage efficiency. If the transfer description displays `transfer_desc=Logical Transfer with Storage Efficiency`, SnapMirror is maintaining storage efficiency. For example:

Logical Transfer with storage

Beginning with ONTAP 9.3, manual update is no longer required to re-enable storage efficiency. If SnapMirror detects that postprocess compression has been disabled, it automatically re-enables storage efficiency at the next scheduled update. Both the source and the destination must be running ONTAP 9.3.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.3, AFF systems manage storage efficiency settings differently from FAS systems after a destination volume is made writeable:

* After you make a destination volume writeable using the `snapmirror break` command, the caching policy on the volume is automatically set to "`auto`" (the default).
+
[NOTE]
====
This behavior is applicable to FlexVol volumes, only, and it does not apply to FlexGroup volumes.
====

* On resync, the caching policy is automatically set to "`none`", and deduplication and inline compression are automatically disabled, regardless of your original settings. You must modify the settings manually as needed.

[NOTE]
====
Manual updates with storage efficiency enabled can be time-consuming. You might want to run the operation in off-peak hours.
====

.Step

. Update a replication relationship and re-enable storage efficiency:
+
`snapmirror update -source-path <SVM:volume>|<cluster://SVM/volume>, ... -destination-path <SVM:volume>|<cluster://SVM/volume>, ... -enable-storage-efficiency true`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
[NOTE]
====
You must run this command from the destination SVM or the destination cluster. The command fails if a common Snapshot copy does not exist on the source and destination. Use `snapmirror initialize` to re-initialize the relationship.
====
+
The following example updates the relationship between the source volume `volA` on `svm1` and the destination volume `volA_dst` on `svm_backup`, and re-enables storage efficiency:
+

cluster_dst::> snapmirror update -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst -enable-storage-efficiency true
