= Delete an ONTAP SnapMirror SVM replication relationship

[.lead]
You can use the `snapmirror delete` and `snapmirror release` commands to delete an SVM replication relationship. You can then delete unneeded destination volumes manually. Learn more about the commands described in this procedure in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/[ONTAP command reference^].

.About this task

The `snapmirror release` command deletes any SnapMirror-created snapshots from the source. You can use the `-relationship-info-only` option to preserve the snapshots.



.Steps

. Run the following command from the destination SVM or the destination cluster to break the replication relationship:
+
`snapmirror break -source-path _SVM_: -destination-path _SVM_:`
+
[NOTE]
====
You must enter a colon (:) after the SVM name in the `-source-path` and `-destination-path` options. See the example below.
====
+
The following example breaks the relationship between the source SVM `svm1` and the destination SVM `svm_backup`:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror break -source-path svm1: -destination-path svm_backup:

. Run the following command from the source cluster or source SVM to release the replication relationship information from the source SVM:
+
`snapmirror release -source-path _SVM_: -destination-path _SVM_:`
+
[NOTE]
====
You must enter a colon (:) after the SVM name in the `-source-path` and `-destination-path` options. See the example below.
====
+
The following example releases information for the specified replication relationship from the source SVM `svm1`:
+
----
cluster_src::> snapmirror release -source-path svm1: -destination-path svm_backup:
