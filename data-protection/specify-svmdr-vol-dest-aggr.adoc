After a disaster recovery SVM is created, you can use the `aggr-list` option with `vserver modify` command to limit which aggregates are used to host SVM DR destination volumes.

.Step

. Create a destination SVM:
+
`vserver create -vserver _SVM_ -subtype dp-destination`

. Modify the disaster recovery SVM's aggr-list to limit the aggregates that are used to host the disaster recovery SVM's volume:
+
`cluster_dest::> vserver modify -vserver _SVM_ -aggr-list <comma-separated-list>`
