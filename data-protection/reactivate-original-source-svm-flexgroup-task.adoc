You can reestablish the original data protection relationship between the source and destination SVM when you no longer need to serve data from the destination. To reactivate the original source SVM when you are using FlexGroup volumes, you need to perform some additional steps, including deleting the original SVM DR relationship and releasing the original relationship before you reverse the relationship. You also need to release the reversed relationship and recreate the original relationship before stopping scheduled transfers.

.Steps

. From the original destination SVM or the original destination cluster, delete the original SVM DR relationship:
+
`snapmirror delete -source-path SVM: -destination-path SVM:`
+
[NOTE]
====
You must enter a colon (:) after the SVM name in the `-source-path` and `-destination-path` options. See the example below.
====
+
The following example deletes the original relationship between the original source SVM, svm1, and the original destination SVM, `svm_backup`:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror delete -source-path svm1: -destination-path svm_backup:
----

. From the original source SVM or the original source cluster, release the original relationship while keeping the Snapshot copies intact:
+
`snapmirror release -source-path SVM: -destination-path SVM: -relationship-info-only true`
+
[NOTE]
====
You must enter a colon (:) after the SVM name in the `-source-path` and `-destination-path` options. See the example below.
====
+
The following example releases the original relationship between the original source SVM, svm1, and the original destination SVM, `svm_backup`.
+
----
cluster_src::> snapmirror release -source-path svm1: -destination-path svm_backup: -relationship-info-only true
----

. From the original source SVM or the original source cluster, create a reverse SVM DR relationship using the same configuration, policy, and identity-preserve setting as the original SVM DR relationship:
+
`snapmirror create -source-path SVM: -destination-path SVM:`
+
[NOTE]
====
You must enter a colon (:) after the SVM name in the `-source-path` and `-destination-path` options. See the example below.
====
+
The following example creates a relationship between the SVM from which you are serving data, `svm_backup`, and the original source SVM, `svm1`:
+
----
cluster_src::> snapmirror create -source-path svm_backup: -destination-path svm1:
----

. From the original source SVM or the original source cluster, run the following command to reverse the data protection relationship:
+
`snapmirror resync -source-path _SVM_: -destination-path _SVM_:`
+
[NOTE]
====
You must enter a colon (:) after the SVM name in the `-source-path` and `-destination-path` options. See the example below.
====
+
Although resync does not require a baseline transfer, it can be time-consuming. You might want to run the resync in off-peak hours.
+
[NOTE]
====
The command fails if a common Snapshot copy does not exist on the source and destination. Use `snapmirror initialize` to reinitialize the relationship.
====
+
The following example reverses the relationship between the original source SVM, `svm1`, and the SVM from which you are serving data, `svm_backup`:
+
----
cluster_src::> snapmirror resync -source-path svm_backup: -destination-path svm1:
----

. When you are ready to reestablish data access to the original source SVM, stop the original destination SVM to disconnect any clients currently connected to the original destination SVM.
+
`vserver stop -vserver _SVM_`
+
The following example stops the original destination SVM which is currently serving data:
+
----
cluster_dst::> vserver stop svm_backup
----

. Verify that the original destination SVM is in the stopped state by using the `vserver show` command.
+
----
cluster_dst::> vserver show
                                  Admin      Operational Root
Vserver        Type    Subtype    State      State       Volume     Aggregate
--------       ------- ---------- ---------- ----------- ---------- ----------
svm_backup     data    default    stopped    stopped     rv         aggr1
----

. From the original source SVM or the original source cluster, run the following command to perform the final update of the reversed relationship to transfer all changes from the original destination SVM to the original source SVM:
+
`snapmirror update -source-path _SVM_: -destination-path _SVM_:`
+
[NOTE]
====
You must enter a colon (:) after the SVM name in the `-source-path` and `-destination-path` options. See the example below.
====
+
The following example updates the relationship between the original destination SVM from which you are serving data,`svm_backup`, and the original source SVM, `svm1`:
+
----
cluster_src::> snapmirror update -source-path svm_backup: -destination-path svm1:
----

. From the original source SVM or the original source cluster, run the following command to stop scheduled transfers for the reversed relationship:
+
`snapmirror quiesce -source-path _SVM_: -destination-path _SVM_:`
+
[NOTE]
====
You must enter a colon (:) after the SVM name in the `-source-path` and `-destination-path` options. See the example below.
====
+
The following example stops scheduled transfers between the SVM you are serving data from, `svm_backup`, and the original SVM, `svm1`:
+
----
cluster_src::> snapmirror quiesce -source-path svm_backup: -destination-path svm1:
----

. When the final update is complete and the relationship indicates "Quiesced" for the relationship status, run the following command from the original source SVM or the original source cluster to break the reversed relationship:
+
`snapmirror break -source-path _SVM_: -destination-path _SVM_:`
+
[NOTE]
====
You must enter a colon (:) after the SVM name in the `-source-path` and `-destination-path` options. See the example below.
====
+
The following example breaks the relationship between the original destination SVM from which you were serving data, `svm_backup`, and the original source SVM, `svm1`:
+
----
cluster_src::> snapmirror break -source-path svm_backup: -destination-path svm1:
----

. If the original source SVM was previously stopped, from the original source cluster, start the original source SVM:
+
`vserver start -vserver _SVM_`
+
The following example starts the original source SVM:
+
----
cluster_src::> vserver start svm1
----

. From the original source SVM or the original source cluster, delete the reversed SVM DR relationship:
+
`snapmirror delete -source-path SVM: -destination-path SVM:`
+
[NOTE]
====
You must enter a colon (:) after the SVM name in the `-source-path` and `-destination-path` options. See the example below.
====
+
The following example deletes the reversed relationship between the original destination SVM, svm_backup, and the original source SVM, `svm1`:
+
----
cluster_src::> snapmirror delete -source-path svm_backup: -destination-path svm1:
----

. From the original destination SVM or the original destination cluster, release the reversed relationship while keeping the Snapshot copies intact:
+
`snapmirror release -source-path SVM: -destination-path SVM: -relationship-info-only true`
+
[NOTE]
====
You must enter a colon (:) after the SVM name in the `-source-path` and `-destination-path` options. See the example below.
====
+
The following example releases the reversed relationship between the original destination SVM, svm_backup, and the original source SVM, svm1:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror release -source-path svm_backup: -destination-path svm1: -relationship-info-only true
----

. From the original destination SVM or the original destination cluster, recreate the original relationship. Use the same configuration, policy, and identity-preserve setting as the original SVM DR relationship:
+
`snapmirror create -source-path SVM: -destination-path SVM:`
+
[NOTE]
====
You must enter a colon (:) after the SVM name in the `-source-path` and `-destination-path` options. See the example below.
====
+
The following example creates a relationship between the original source SVM, `svm1`, and the original destination SVM, `svm_backup`:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror create -source-path svm1: -destination-path svm_backup:
----

. From the original destination SVM or the original destination cluster, reestablish the original data protection relationship:
+
`snapmirror resync -source-path _SVM_: -destination-path _SVM_:`
+
[NOTE]
====
You must enter a colon (:) after the SVM name in the `-source-path` and `-destination-path` options. See the example below.
====
+
The following example reestablishes the relationship between the original source SVM, `svm1`, and the original destination SVM, `svm_backup`:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror resync -source-path svm1: -destination-path svm_backup:
