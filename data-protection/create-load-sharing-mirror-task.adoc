summary: "You should create a load-sharing mirror (LSM) for each root volume in the cluster. You can create the LSM on any node other than the one containing the root volume, such as the partner node in an HA pair, or preferably in a different HA pair. For a two-node cluster, you should create the LSM on the partner of the node with the root volume."

You should create a load-sharing mirror (LSM) for each SVM root volume that serves NAS data in the cluster. You can create the LSM on any node other than the one containing the root volume, such as the partner node in an HA pair, or preferably in a different HA pair. 

LSM is not suitable for single HA clusters, and it should be configured for multiple HA pair clusters, configuring the LSM between the node with the root volume and another node from a different HA pair.

.About this task

If you create an LSM on the same node, and the node is unavailable, you have a single point of failure, and you do not have a second copy to ensure the data remains accessible to clients. But when you create the LSM on a node other than the one containing the root volume, or on a different HA pair, your data is still accessible in the event of an outage.

For example, in a four-node cluster with a root volume on three nodes:

* For the root volume on HA 1 node 1, create the LSM on HA 2 node 1 or HA 2 node 2.
* For the root volume on HA 1 node 2, create the LSM on HA 2 node 1 or HA 2 node 2.
* For the root volume on HA 2 node 1, create the LSM on HA 1 node 1 or HA 1 node 2.

.Steps

. Create a destination volume for the LSM:
+
`volume create -vserver _SVM_ -volume volume -aggregate _aggregate_ -type DP -size size`
+
The destination volume should be the same or greater in size than the root volume.
+
It is a best practice to name the root and destination volume with suffixes, such as `_root` and `_m1`.
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
The following example creates a load-sharing mirror volume for the root volume `svm1_root` in `cluster_src`:
+
----
cluster_src:> volume create -vserver svm1 -volume svm1_m1 -aggregate aggr_1 -size 1gb -state online -type DP
----

. Create a replication job schedule, as described in link:create-replication-job-schedule-task.html[Creating a replication job schedule].
. Create a load-sharing mirror relationship between the SVM root volume and the destination volume for the LSM:
+
`snapmirror create -source-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_ -destination-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_ -type LS -schedule _schedule_`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
The following example creates a load-sharing mirror relationship between the root volume `svm1_root` and the load-sharing mirror volume `svm1_m1`:
+
----
cluster_src::> snapmirror create -source-path svm1:svm1_root -destination-path svm1:svm1_m1 -type LS -schedule hourly
----
+
The type attribute of the load-sharing mirror changes from `DP` to `LS`.

. Initialize the load-sharing mirror:
+
`snapmirror initialize-ls-set -source-path _SVM:volume_|_cluster://SVM/volume_`
+
Initialization can be time-consuming. You might want to run the baseline transfer in off-peak hours.
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
The following example initializes the load-sharing mirror for the root volume `svm1_root`:
+
----
cluster_src::> snapmirror initialize-ls-set -source-path svm1:svm1_root
