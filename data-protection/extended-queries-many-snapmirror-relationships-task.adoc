You can use _extended queries_ to perform SnapMirror operations on many SnapMirror relationships at one time. For example, you might have multiple uninitialized SnapMirror relationships that you want to initialize using one command.

.About this task

You can apply extended queries to the following SnapMirror operations:

* Initializing uninitialized relationships
* Resuming quiesced relationships
* Resynchronizing broken relationships
* Updating idle relationships
* Aborting relationship data transfers
