You can use the `snapmirror snapshot-owner create` command to preserve a labeled Snapshot copy on the secondary in a mirror-vault deployment. Doing so ensures that a common Snapshot copy exists for the update of the vault relationship.

.About this task

If you use a combination mirror-vault fan-out or cascade deployment, you should keep in mind that updates will fail if a common Snapshot copy does not exist on the source and destination volumes.

This is never an issue for the mirror relationship in a mirror-vault fan-out or cascade deployment, since SnapMirror always creates a Snapshot copy of the source volume before it performs the update.

It might be an issue for the vault relationship, however, since SnapMirror does not create a Snapshot copy of the source volume when it updates a vault relationship. You need to use the `snapmirror snapshot-owner create` to ensure that there is at least one common Snapshot copy on both the source and destination of the vault relationship.

.Steps

. On the source volume, assign an owner to the labeled Snapshot copy you want to preserve:
+
`snapmirror snapshot-owner create -vserver <SVM> -volume <volume> -snapshot <snapshot> -owner <owner>`
+
The following example assigns `ApplicationA` as the owner of the `snap1` Snapshot copy:
+
----
clust1::> snapmirror snapshot-owner create -vserver vs1 -volume vol1
-snapshot snap1 -owner ApplicationA
----

. Update the mirror relationship, as described in link:update-replication-relationship-manual-task.html[Updating a replication relationship manually].
+
Alternatively, you can wait for the scheduled update of the mirror relationship.

. Transfer the labeled Snapshot copy to the vault destination:
+
`snapmirror update -source-path <SVM:volume>|<cluster://SVM/volume>, ... -destination-path <SVM:volume>|<cluster://SVM/volume>, ... -source-snapshot snapshot`
+
Learn more about `snapmirror update` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/snapmirror-update.html[ONTAP command reference^].
+
The following example transfers the `snap1` Snapshot copy::
+
----
clust1::> snapmirror update -vserver vs1 -volume vol1
-source-snapshot snap1
----
+
The labeled Snapshot copy will be preserved when the vault relationship is updated.

. On the source volume, remove the owner from the labeled Snapshot copy:
+
`snapmirror snapshot-owner delete -vserver _SVM_ -volume _volume_ -snapshot _snapshot_ -owner _owner_`
+
The following examples removes `ApplicationA` as the owner of the `snap1` Snapshot copy:
+
----
clust1::> snapmirror snapshot-owner delete -vserver vs1 -volume vol1
-snapshot snap1 -owner ApplicationA
