Beginning with ONTAP 9.3, licensing has been simplified for replicating between ONTAP instances. In ONTAP 9 releases, the SnapMirror license supports both vault and mirror relationships. Users can now purchase a SnapMirror license to support ONTAP replication for both backup and disaster recovery use cases.

Prior to the ONTAP 9.3 release, two licenses were available to support different replication use cases. A SnapVault license was needed to configure _vault_ relationships between ONTAP instances, where the DP instance could retain a higher number of Snapshot copies to support backup use cases where retention times are longer. A SnapMirror license was needed to configure _mirror_ relationships between ONTAP instances, where each ONTAP instance would maintain the same number of snapshot copies (that is, a _mirror_ image) to support disaster recovery use cases where cluster failovers would be possible. Both SnapMirror and SnapVault licenses can continue to be used and supported for ONTAP 8.x and 9.x releases.

SnapVault licenses continue to function and are supported for both ONTAP 8.x and 9.x releases, but they are no longer being sold. The SnapMirror license continues to be available and can be used in place of SnapVault and can be used for both mirror and vault configurations.

For ONTAP asynchronous replication, beginning with ONTAP 9.3 a single unified replication engine is used to configure extended data protection mode (XDP) policies, where the SnapMirror license can be configured for a mirror policy, a vault policy, or a mirror-vault policy. A SnapMirror license is required on both the source and destination clusters. A SnapVault license is not required if a SnapMirror license is already installed. The SnapMirror asynchronous perpetual license is included in the Data Protection bundle which you can purchase for your ONTAP clusters. The Data Protection bundle price is based on the raw capacity of the cluster. 

Data protection configuration limits are determined using several factors, including your ONTAP version, hardware platform, and the licenses installed. For more information, see https://hwu.netapp.com/[Hardware Universe^].

== SnapMirror Synchronous license

Beginning with ONTAP 9.5, SnapMirror Synchronous relationships are supported. You require the following licenses for creating a SnapMirror Synchronous relationship:

* The SnapMirror Synchronous license is required on both the source cluster and the destination cluster.
+
The SnapMirror Synchronous license is enabled with either the Premium bundle or the Data Protection bundle.
+
If your system was purchased before June 2019 with a Premium or Flash Bundle, you can download a NetApp master key to get the required SnapMirror Synchronous license from the NetApp Support Site: https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/knowledge/docs/olio/guides/master_lickey/[Master License Keys]

* The SnapMirror license is required on both the source cluster and the destination cluster.

== SnapMirror Cloud license

Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, the SnapMirror Cloud license provides asynchronous replication of Snapshot copies from ONTAP instances to object storage endpoints. Replication targets can be configured using both on-premises object stores as well as S3 and S3-compatible public cloud object storage services. SnapMirror Cloud relationships are supported from ONTAP systems to pre-qualified object storage targets. ONTAP 9.8 approved object storage targets include ONTAP S3, StorageGRID, AWS S3 Standard, S3 Standard-IA, and S3 One Zone-IA, Microsoft Azure Blob Premium, Hot and Cool, and GCP Standard and Nearline storage.

SnapMirror Cloud is not available as a standalone license and is available only with purchase of the Hybrid Cloud Bundle. Hybrid Cloud Bundle is a term-based subscription license that is priced based on capacity. Only one license is needed per ONTAP cluster. Capacity is defined as the “used” capacity (not raw capacity) within any volume which is protected by SnapMirror Cloud. Users will purchase this license based on the total used capacity of volumes on the cluster being backed up by SnapMirror Cloud. As of October 2021, the Hybrid Cloud Bundle includes only a SnapMirror Cloud license (previously Hybrid Cloud Bundle included a FabricPool license, which was removed from the bundle effective October 2021). In addition to SnapMirror Cloud, the async SnapMirror license is also required and is available only with the purchase of the Data Protection Bundle.

You require the following licenses for creating a SnapMirror Cloud relationship:

* Both a SnapMirror license (purchased through Data Protection Bundle, or through Premium Bundle) and a SnapMirror Cloud license (purchased through Hybrid Cloud Bundle) are needed for replicating directly to the object store endpoint.
* When configuring a multi-policy replication workflow (for example, Disk-to-Disk-to-Cloud), a SnapMirror license is required on all ONTAP instances, while the SnapMirror Cloud license is only required for the source cluster which is replicating directly to the object storage endpoint.

SnapMirror Cloud is an end user license which can be purchased from NetApp or from an approved NetApp reseller partner. The SnapMirror Cloud license provides end user entitlement but does not enable asynchronous ONTAP to object storage replication. To invoke ONTAP APIs for SnapMirror Cloud, a unique API key from an authorized application is required. Authorized and licensed applications used to orchestrate SnapMirror Cloud replication include System Manager, and are also available from multiple third-party application providers. These authorized applications will embed the unique API key to invoke ONTAP APIs. A combination of the SnapMirror Cloud end user license and an authorized third-party backup application is required to orchestrate and enable SnapMirror Cloud replication.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, you can use System Manager for SnapMirror Cloud replication. For more information, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/task_dp_back_up_to_cloud.html[Back up to the cloud].

A list of authorized SnapMirror Cloud third-party applications is published on the NetApp web site.

== Data Protection Optimized (DPO)

Beginning with ONTAP 9.1, new ONTAP data protection features were packaged with the FAS8200 as part of a solution called the Data Protection Bundle. This new hardware and software bundle included a new DP_Optimized (DPO) license that provided unique ONTAP features for secondary workloads. With the introduction of ONTAP 9.3 the DPO license increased the number of volumes per node from 1,000 to 1,500. Also introduced with ONTAP 9.3 were new configurations of the Data Protection Bundle based on configurations of FAS2620.

The DPO license was specifically designed for ONTAP clusters that were to be dedicated as secondary targets for SnapMirror replication. In addition to increasing the maximum volumes per node on the DPO controller, the DPO license also modified controller QoS settings to support greater replication traffic at the expense of application I/O. For this reason, the DPO license should never be installed on a cluster that supports application I/O, as application performance would be impacted. Later, Data Protection Bundles based on the FAS8200 and FAS2620 were offered as a solution and included programmatic free licenses based on the customer environment. When purchasing the solution bundles, free SnapMirror licenses would be provided for select older clusters which replicated to the DPO secondary. While the DPO license is needed on the Data Protection solution cluster, primary clusters from the following platform list would be provided free SnapMirror licenses. Primary clusters not included in this list would require purchase of SnapMirror licenses. The DPO hardware and software bundle was based on both FAS2620 and FAS8200 systems which are both EOA status and no are longer available.

* FAS2200 Series
* FAS3000 Series
* FAS6000 Series
* FAS8000 Series

== Data Protection Optimized (DPO) License

Data Protection hardware and software solution bundles introduced with ONTAP 9.1 and 9.3 were based on FAS8200 and FAS2620 only. As these platforms matured and new platforms were introduced new requests to support ONTAP features for secondary replication use cases increased. As a result, a new standalone DPO license was introduced in November 2018 with the ONTAP 9.5 release.

The standalone DPO license was supported on both FAS and AFF platforms and could be purchased pre-configured with new clusters or added to deployed clusters as a software upgrade in the field. Because these new DPO licenses were not part of a hardware and software solution bundle, they carried a lower price, and free SnapMirror licenses for primary clusters were not provided. Secondary clusters configured with the a la carte DPO license must also purchase a SnapMirror license, and all primary clusters replicating to the DPO secondary cluster must purchase a SnapMirror license.

Additional ONTAP features were delivered with the DPO across multiple ONTAP releases.

* Details about priority for the SnapMirror backoff (workload bias) feature:

* Client: cluster I/O priority is set to client workloads (production apps), not SnapMirror traffic.

* Equality: SnapMirror replication requests have equal priority to I/O for production apps.

* SnapMirror: all SnapMirror I/O requests have higher priority that I/O for production apps.

== Considerations for all new DPO installations

* After it is enabled, the DPO license feature cannot be disabled or undone.
* Installation of the DPO license requires a re-boot of ONTAP or failover to enable.
* The DPO solution is intended for secondary storage workloads; application workload performance on DPO clusters may be impacted
* The DPO license is supported on a select list of NetApp storage platform models.
* DPO features vary by ONTAP release. Refer to the compatibility table for reference.
* New FAS and AFF systems are not qualified with DPO. DPO licenses cannot be purchased for clusters not listed above.
