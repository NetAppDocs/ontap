A Snapshot policy requires at least one snapshot job schedule. You can use System Manager or the `job schedule cron create` command to create a job schedule.

.About this task

This procedure applies to FAS, AFF, and current ASA systems. If you have an ASA r2 system (ASA A1K, ASA A70, or ASA A90), follow link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/asa-r2/data-protection/policies-schedules.html#create-a-new-protection-policy-schedule[these steps^] to create a snapshot job schedule. ASA r2 systems provide a simplified ONTAP experience specific to SAN-only customers.

By default, ONTAP forms the names of snapshots by appending a timestamp to the job schedule name.

If you specify values for both day of the month and day of the week, the values are considered independently. For example, a cron schedule with the day specification `Friday` and the day of the month specification `13` runs every Friday and on the 13th day of each month, not just on every Friday the 13th.

+
[source,cli]
----
job schedule cron create -name <job_name> -month <month> -dayofweek <day_of_week> -day <day_of_month> -hour <hour> -minute <minute>
----
+
For `-month`, `-dayofweek`, and `-hour`, you can specify `all` to run the job every month, day of the week, and hour, respectively.
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can include the Vserver for your job schedule:

The following example creates a job schedule named `myweekly` that runs on Saturdays at 3:00 a.m.:
+
----
cluster1::> job schedule cron create -name myweekly -dayofweek "Saturday" -hour 3 -minute 0
----
+
The following example creates a schedule named `myweeklymulti` that specifies multiple days, hours and minutes:
+
----
job schedule cron create -name myweeklymulti -dayofweek "Monday,Wednesday,Sunday" -hour 3,9,12 -minute 0,20,50
