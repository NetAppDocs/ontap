You need to resynchronize a replication relationship after you make a destination volume writeable, after an update fails because a common Snapshot copy does not exist on the source and destination volumes, or if you want to change the replication policy for the relationship. 

Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can use System Manager to perform a reverse resynchronization operation to delete an existing protection relationship and reverse the functions of the source and destination volumes. Then you use the destination volume to serve data while you repair or replace the source, update the source, and reestablish the original configuration of the systems.

.About this task

* Although resync does not require a baseline transfer, it can be time-consuming. You might want to run the resync in off-peak hours.
* Volumes that are part of a fan-out or cascade configuration can take longer to resynchronize. It is not uncommon to see the SnapMirror relationship reporting the status "preparing" for an extended time period. 

[NOTE]
====
System Manager does not support reverse resynchronization with intracluster relationships. You can use the ONTAP CLI to perform reverse resync operations with intracluster relationships.
====

// This doesn't look correct. Removing for now and checking with SME. When you perform a _reverse resync_ operation, any data on the source volume that is newer than the data in the common Snapshot copy is deleted.

.Steps

You can use System Manager or the ONTAP CLI to perform this task. If you use the ONTAP CLI, the procedure is the same regardless of whether you are making a destination volume writable or you are updating the replication relationship.

After you link:make-destination-volume-writeable-task.html[break a relationship] to make a destination writable, reverse resynchronize the relationship: 

. On the destination cluster, click *Protection > Relationships*.

. Hover over the broken off relationship you want to reverse, click image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon], and select *Reverse Resync*.

. In the *Reverse resync relationship* window, click *Reverse resync*.

. Under *Relationships*, monitor the reverse resynchronization progress by viewing *Transfer Status* for the relationship.

.Next steps:
When the original source is available again, you can reestablish the original relationship by breaking the reversed relationship and performing another reverse resync operation. The reverse resync process will copy any changes from the site that is serving data to the original source and make the original source read-writable again.

. Click *Protection > Relationships*.

. Hover over the relationship you want to resynchronize, and click image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon] and then select *Break*.

. When the relationship state displays "Broken off," click image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon] and then select *Resync*.

. Under *Relationships*, monitor the resynchronization progress by checking the relationship state. The state changes to "Mirrored" when resynchronization is complete.

. Resync the source and destination volumes:
+
[source,cli]
----
snapmirror resync -source-path <SVM:volume|cluster://SVM/volume> -destination-path <SVM:volume|cluster://SVM/volume> -type DP|XDP -policy <policy>
----
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
[NOTE]
You must run this command from the destination SVM or the destination cluster.
+
The following example resynchronizes the relationship between the source volume `volA` on `svm1` and the destination volume `volA_dst` on `svm_backup`:
+
----
cluster_dst::> snapmirror resync -source-path svm1:volA -destination-path svm_backup:volA_dst
