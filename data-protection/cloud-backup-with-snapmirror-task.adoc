Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, you can back up your data to the cloud and to restore your data from cloud storage to a different volume by using System Manager. You can use either StorageGRID or ONTAP S3 as your cloud object store.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.16.1: 

* SnapMirror cloud backup supports fan-out relationships. This means that SnapMirror backups can be created simultaneously on two different object stores. With ONTAP 9.16.1, SnapMirror cloud supports two fan-out relationships. Fan-outs can be to two object stores and to one or two buckets in two different object stores. Attempts to create more than two fan-out relationships will fail.
* SnapMirror cloud supports backups of volumes migrated to the cloud using a more efficient synchronization process using existing link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-automation/get-started/access_rest_api.html[ONTAP REST APIs^]. The functionality supports SnapMirror cloud backups from a migrated volume in the cloud to the same destination object store endpoint without the need for performing a re-baseline operation. Both FlexVol and FlexGroup volumes are supported.

Before using the SnapMirror cloud feature, you should request a SnapMirror cloud API license key from the NetApp Support Site: link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools/snapmirror-cloud-api-key[Request SnapMirror cloud API license key^]. 
Following the instructions, you should provide a simple description of your business opportunity and request the API key by sending an email to the provided email address. You should receive an email response within 24 hours with further instructions on how to acquire the API key.


== Add a cloud object store

Before you configure SnapMirror cloud backups, you need to add a StorageGRID or ONTAP S3 cloud object store.

.Steps

. Click *Protection > Overview > Cloud Object Stores*.

. Click image:icon_add.gif[Add icon].

== Back up using the default policy

You can quickly configure a SnapMirror cloud backup for an existing volume using the default cloud protection policy, DailyBackup.

.Steps

. Click *Protection > Overview* and select *Back Up Volumes to Cloud*.

. If this is your first time backing up to the cloud, enter your SnapMirror cloud API license key in the license field as indicated.

. Click *Authenticate and Continue*.

. Select a source volume.

. Select a cloud object store.

. Click *Save*.

== Create a custom cloud backup policy

If you do not want to use the default DailyBackup cloud policy for your SnapMirror cloud backups, you can create your own policy.

.Steps

. Click *Protection > Overview > Local Policy Settings* and select *Protection Policies*.

. Click *Add* and enter the new policy details.

. In the *Policy Type* section, select *Back up to Cloud* to indicate that you are creating a cloud policy.

. Click *Save*.

== Create a backup from the *Volumes* page

You can use the System Manager *Volumes* page when you want to select and create cloud backups for multiple volumes at one time or when you want to use a custom protection policy.

.Steps

. Click *Storage > Volumes*.

. Select the volumes you want to back up to the cloud, and click *Protect*.

. In the *Protect Volume* window, click *More Options*.

. Select a policy.
+
You can select the default policy, DailyBackup, or a custom cloud policy you created.

. Select a cloud object store.

. Click *Save*.

== Restore from the cloud

You can use System Manager to restore backed up data from cloud storage to a different volume on the source cluster.

[NOTE]
If you are using ONTAP 9.16.1 or later and you are performing a SnapMirror cloud single file restore to a FlexGroup volume, you should only restore files to a new directory in the FlexGroup volume, and granular data must be set to `advanced` on the destination FlexGroup volume. For more information about setting the `-granular-data advanced` option, see link:../flexgroup/enable-adv-capacity-flexgroup-task.html[Balance ONTAP FlexGroup volumes by redistributing file data].

.Steps
// BURT 1418445 correction in workflow, 10 SEP 2021

. From the source Cluster of a SnapMirror-to-Cloud relationship, click *Storage > Volumes*.

. Select the volume you want to restore.

. Select the *Back Up to Cloud* tab.

. Click image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon] next to the source volume you want to restore to display the menu, and select *Restore*.

. Under *Source*, select a storage VM and then enter the name of the volume to which you want the data restored.

. Under *Destination*, select the snapshot you want to restore.

. Click *Save*.

== Delete a SnapMirror cloud relationship

You can use System Manager to delete a cloud relationship.

.Steps

. Click *Storage > Volumes* and select the volume you want to delete.

. Click image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon] next to the source volume and select *Delete*.

. Select *Delete the cloud object store endpoint (optional)* if you want to delete the cloud object store endpoint.

. Click *Delete*.


== Remove a cloud object store

You can use System Manager to remove a cloud object store if it is not part of a cloud backup relationship. When a cloud object store is part of a cloud backup relationship, it cannot be deleted.

.Steps

. Click *Protection > Overview > Cloud Object Stores*.

. Select the object store you want to delete, click image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon] and select *Delete*.
