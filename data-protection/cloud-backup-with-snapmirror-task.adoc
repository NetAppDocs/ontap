Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, you can back up your data to the cloud and to restore your data from cloud storage to a different volume by using System Manager. You can use either StorageGRID or ONTAP S3 as your cloud object store.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.16.1, SnapMirror cloud backup supports fanout relationships. This means that SnapMirror backups can be created simultaneously on two different object stores.

Before using the SnapMirror cloud feature, you should request a SnapMirror cloud API license key from the NetApp Support Site: link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools/snapmirror-cloud-api-key[Request SnapMirror cloud API license key^]. 
Following the instructions, you should provide a simple description of your business opportunity and request the API key by sending an email to the provided email address. You should receive an email response within 24 hours with further instructions on how to acquire the API key.
