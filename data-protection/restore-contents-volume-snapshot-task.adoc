[.lead]
You can recover a volume to an earlier point in time by restoring from a snapshot. You can use System Manager or the `volume snapshot restore` command to restore the contents of a volume from a snapshot.

.About this task

If the volume has SnapMirror relationships, manually replicate all mirror copies of the volume immediately after you restore from a snapshot. Not doing so can result in unusable mirror copies that must be deleted and recreated.


.Steps
You can use System Manager or the ONTAP CLI to restore from an earlier snapshot.
