summary: "A snapshot policy defines how the system creates snapshots. The policy specifies when to create snapshots, how many copies to retain, and how to name them. For example, a system might create one snapshot every day at 12:10 a.m., retain the two most recent copies, and name the copies 'daily.timestamp.'"

A _snapshot policy_ defines how the system creates snapshots. The policy specifies when to create snapshots, how many copies to retain, and how to name them. For example, a system might create one snapshot every day at 12:10 a.m., retain the two most recent copies, and name the copies "`daily.`_timestamp_`.`"

The default policy for a volume automatically creates snapshots on the following schedule, with the oldest snapshots deleted to make room for newer copies:

* A maximum of six hourly snapshots taken five minutes past the hour.
* A maximum of two daily snapshots taken Monday through Saturday at 10 minutes after midnight.
* A maximum of two weekly snapshots taken every Sunday at 15 minutes after midnight.

Unless you specify a snapshot policy when you create a volume, the volume inherits the snapshot policy associated with its containing storage virtual machine (SVM).
