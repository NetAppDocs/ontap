= Restore a single file, LUN, or NVMe namespace from a SnapMirror destination
:icons: font

[.lead]
You can restore a single file, LUN, a set of files or LUNs from a Snapshot, or an NVMe namespace from a SnapMirror destination volume. Beginning with ONTAP 9.7, you can also restore NVMe namespaces from a SnapMirror synchronous destination. You can restore files to the original source volume or to a different volume.

.What you'll need

To restore a file or LUN from a SnapMirror synchronous destination (supported beginning with ONTAP 9.5), you must first delete and release the relationship.

.About this task

The volume to which you are restoring files or LUNs (the destination volume) must be a read-write volume:

* SnapMirror performs an _incremental restore_ if the source and destination volumes have a common Snapshot (as is typically the case when you are restoring to the original source volume).
* Otherwise, SnapMirror performs a _baseline restore_, in which the specified Snapshot and all the data blocks it references are transferred to the destination volume.

.Steps

. List the Snapshot copies in the destination volume:
+
`volume snapshot show -vserver <SVM> -volume volume`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
The following example shows the Snapshot copies on the `vserverB:secondary1` destination:

. Restore a single file or LUN or a set of files or LUNs from a snapshot in a SnapMirror destination volume:
+
`snapmirror restore -source-path <SVM:volume>|<cluster://SVM/volume>, ... -destination-path <SVM:volume>|<cluster://SVM/volume>, ... -source-snapshot snapshot -file-list <source_file_path,@destination_file_path>`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.

[NOTE]
====
You must run this command from the destination SVM or the destination cluster.

The following command restores the files `file1` and `file2` from the snapshot `daily.2013-01-25_0010` in the original destination volume `secondary1`, to the same location in the active file system of the original source volume `primary1`:
+
----

cluster_dst::> snapmirror restore -source-path vserverB:secondary1 -destination-path vserverA:primary1 -source-snapshot daily.2013-01-25_0010 -file-list /dir1/file1,/dir2/file2

The following command restores the files `file1` and `file2` from the snapshot `daily.2013-01-25_0010` in the original destination volume `secondary1`, to a different location in the active file system of the original source volume `primary1`.
+
The destination file path begins with the @ symbol followed by the path of the file from the root of the original source volume. In this example, `file1` is restored to `/dir1/file1.new` and file2 is restored to `/dir2.new/file2` on `primary1`:

cluster_dst::> snapmirror restore -source-path vserverB:secondary1 -destination-path vserverA:primary1 -source-snapshot daily.2013-01-25_0010 -file-list /dir/file1,@/dir1/file1.new,/dir2/file2,@/dir2.new/file2

The following command restores the files `file1` and `file3` from the snapshot `daily.2013-01-25_0010` in the original destination volume `secondary1`, to different locations in the active file system of the original source volume `primary1`, and restores `file2` from `snap1` to the same location in the active file system of `primary1`.
+
In this example, the file `file1` is restored to `/dir1/file1.new` and `file3` is restored to `/dir3.new/file3`:
