A user on an NFS or SMB client can restore a file directly from a snapshot without the intervention of a storage system administrator.

Every directory in the file system contains a subdirectory named `.snapshot` accessible to NFS and SMB users. The `.snapshot` subdirectory contains subdirectories corresponding to the snapshots of the volume:

 $ ls .snapshot
 daily.2017-05-14_0013/              hourly.2017-05-15_1106/
 daily.2017-05-15_0012/              hourly.2017-05-15_1206/
 hourly.2017-05-15_1006/             hourly.2017-05-15_1306/

Each subdirectory contains the files referenced by the snapshot. If users accidentally delete or overwrite a file, they can restore the file to the parent read-write directory by copying the file from the snapshot subdirectory to the read-write directory:

 $ ls my.txt
 ls: my.txt: No such file or directory
 $ ls .snapshot
 daily.2017-05-14_0013/              hourly.2017-05-15_1106/
 daily.2017-05-15_0012/              hourly.2017-05-15_1206/
 hourly.2017-05-15_1006/             hourly.2017-05-15_1306/
 $ ls .snapshot/hourly.2017-05-15_1306/my.txt
 my.txt
 $ cp .snapshot/hourly.2017-05-15_1306/my.txt .
 $ ls my.txt
 my.txt
