Before you deploy FlexCache in write-back mode, ensure you have met these performance, software, licensing, and system configuration requirements.

== CPU and Memory

Each origin cluster node should have at least 128GB of RAM and 20 CPUs to absorb the write-back messages initiated by write-back enabled caches. This is the equivalent of an A400 or greater. If the origin cluster serves as the origin to multiple write-back enabled FlexCaches, it will require more CPU and RAM.

CAUTION: Using an undersized origin for your workload can have profound impacts on performance at the write-back-enabled cache or the origin.

== ONTAP version

* The origin *_must_* be running ONTAP 9.15.1 or later.
* Any caching cluster that needs to operate in write-back mode *_must_* be running ONTAP 9.15.1 or later.
* Any caching cluster that does not need to operate in write-back mode can run any generally supported ONTAP version.
//what is a supported ontap version?

== Licensing

FlexCache, including the write-back mode of operation, is included with your ONTAP purchase. No extra license is required.

== Peering

* The origin and cache clusters must be link:../flexcache-writeback/flexcache-writeback-enable-task.html[cluster peered]
* The server virtual machines (SVMs) on the origin and cache cluster must be link:../flexcache-writeback/flexcache-writeback-enable-task.html[vserver peered] with the FlexCache option. 

NOTE: You do not need to peer a cache cluster to another cache cluster. There is also no need to peer a cache SVM to another cache SVM.
