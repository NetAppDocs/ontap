== Enable telemetry logging

Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can use System Manager to enable telemetry logging.  When telemetry logging is allowed, messages that are logged by System Manager are given a specific telemetry identifier that indicates the exact process that triggered the message.  All messages that are issued relating to that process have the same identifier, which consists of the name of the operational workflow and a number (for example "add-volume-1941290").  

If you experience performance problems, you can enable telemetry logging, which allows support personnel to more easily identify the specific process for which a message was issued.  When telemetry identifiers are added to the messages, the log file is only slightly enlarged.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster > Settings*.
. In *UI Settings* section, click the check box for *Allow telemetry logging*.
