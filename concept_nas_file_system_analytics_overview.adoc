File System Analytics (FSA) is a framework for collecting and visualizing key data points about the contents of ONTAP FlexGroup or FlexVol volumes. FSA helps solve organizational data challenges around data locality, storage consumption, storage optimization, and data protection. By providing real-time insights into data usage, FSA helps you with decision-making in effective data management and operations, such as quality-of-service changes to throughput and moving volumes to primary storage and secondary storage. File System Analytics is available beginning in ONTAP 9.8.

File System Analytics presents detailed information at each level of the volume's file system hierarchy, allowing you to:

* xref:task_nas_file_system_analytics_view.adoc[Monitor file and directory counts]
* xref:./file-system-analytics/activity-tracking-task.adoc[Evaluate file activity and history]
* xref:task_nas_file_system_analytics_view.adoc[Capture information on inactive data]
* xref:task_nas_file_system_analytics_take_corrective_action.adoc[Take corrective action based on insights (beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1)]
* xref:./file-system-analytics/activity-tracking-task.adoc[Analyze and download information on high traffic and high throughput activity (beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1)]

File System Analytics data is displayed using ONTAP System Manager. You can also use the ONTAP REST API to access the data programmatically.
