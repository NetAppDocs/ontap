An automatic unplanned failover (AUFO) operation occurs when the primary cluster is down or isolated. The mediator detects when a failover occurs and, and executes an automatic unplanned failover to the the secondary cluster. The secondary cluster is converted to the primary and begins serving clients. This operation is performed only with assistance from the ONTAP Mediator.

[NOTE]
After the automatic unplanned failover, it is important to rescan the host LUN I/O paths so that there is no loss of I/O paths.

== Reestablish the protection relationship after an unplanned failover

You can reestablish the protection relationship using System Manager or the ONTAP CLI.

====

.System Manager
--
.Steps
. Navigate to *Protection > Relationships* and wait for the relationship state to show “InSync.”
. To resume operations on the original source cluster, click image:icon_kabob.gif[kabob icon] and select *Failover*.
--

.CLI
--
You can monitor the status of the automatic unplanned failover using the `snapmirror failover show` command.

For example:

....
ClusterB::> snapmirror failover show -instance
Start Time: 9/23/2020 22:03:29
         Source Path: vs1:/cg/scg3
    Destination Path: vs3:/cg/dcg3
     Failover Status: completed
        Error Reason:
            End Time: 9/23/2020 22:03:30
Primary Data Cluster: cluster-2
Last Progress Update: -
       Failover Type: unplanned
  Error Reason codes: -
....
