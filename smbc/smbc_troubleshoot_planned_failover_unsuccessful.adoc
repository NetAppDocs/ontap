.Issue:

After executing the `snapmirror failover start` command, the output for the `snapmirror failover show` command displays a message indicates that a nondisruptive operation is in progress.

.Example:

....
Cluster1::> snapmirror failover show
Source Destination Error
Path Path Type Status start-time end-time Reason
-------- ----------- -------- --------- ---------- ---------- ----------
vs1:/cg/cg vs0:/cg/cg planned failed 10/1/2020 10/1/2020 SnapMirror Failover cannot start because a volume move is running. Retry the command once volume move has finished.
                                                          08:35:04 08:35:04
....

.Cause:

A planned failover cannot begin when a nondisruptive operation is in progress, including volume move, aggregate relocation, and storage failover.

.Solution:

Wait for the nondisruptive operation to complete and try the failover operation again.
