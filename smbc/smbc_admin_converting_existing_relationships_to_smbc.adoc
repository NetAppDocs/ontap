You can convert an existing zero recovery point protection (zero RPO) Synchronous SnapMirror relationship to an SM-BC zero RTO Synchronous SnapMirror consistency group relationship.

.Before you begin

* A zero RPO Synchronous SnapMirror relationship exists between the primary and secondary
* All LUNs on the destination volume are unmapped before the zero RTO SnapMirror relationship is created

.About this task

* You must be a cluster and SVM administrator on the source and destination.
* You cannot convert zero RPO to zero RTO sync by changing the SnapMirror policy.
* If existing LUNs on the secondary volume are mapped, `snapmirror create` with AutomatedFailover policy triggers an error.
You must ensure the LUNs are unmapped before issuing the `snapmirror create` command.

.Steps

. Perform a SnapMirror update operation on the existing relationship:
+
`destination::>snapmirror update -destination-path vs1_dst:vol1`

. Verify that the SnapMirror update completed successfully:
+
`destination::>snapmirror show`

. Quiesce each of the zero RPO synchronous relationships:
+
`destination::>snapmirror quiesce -destination-path vs1_dst:vol1`
+
`destination::>snapmirror quiesce -destination-path vs1_dst:vol2`

. Delete each of the zero RPO synchronous relationships:
+
`destination::>snapmirror delete -destination-path vs1_dst:vol1`
+
`destination::>snapmirror delete -destination-path vs1_dst:vol2`

. Release the source SnapMirror relationship but retain the common Snapshot copies:
+
`source::>snapmirror release -relationship-info-only true -destination-path vs1_dst:vol1`
+
`source::>snapmirror release -relationship-info-only true -destination-path vs1_dst:vol2`

. Create a group zero RTO Synchronous Snapmirror relationship:
+
`destination::> snapmirror create -source-path vs1_src:/cg/cg_src -destination-path vs1_dst:/cg/cg_dst -cg-item-mappings vol1:@vol1,vol2:@vol2 -policy AutomatedFailover`

. Resynchronize the zero RTO consistency group:
+
`destination::> snapmirror resync -destination-path vs1_dst:/cg/cg_dst`

. Rescan host LUN I/O paths to restore all paths to the LUNs.
