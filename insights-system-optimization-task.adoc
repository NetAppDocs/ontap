[.lead]
With System Manager, you can view insights that help you optimize your system.

.About this task

Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.0, you can view insights in System Manager that help you optimize the capacity and security compliance of your system.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, you can view additional insights that help you optimize the capacity, security compliance, and configuration of your system.

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Blocking extensions might lead to unexpected results.*  Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, you can enable native FPolicy for storage VMs using System Manager. You might receive a System Manager Insight message recommending that you link:insights-configure-native-fpolicy-task.html[configure native FPolicy] for a storage VM. 

With FPolicy Native Mode, you can allow or disallow specific file extensions. System Manager recommends over 3000 disallowed file extensions that have been used in past ransomware attacks.  Some of these extensions might be used by legitimate files in your environment and blocking them might lead to unexpected issues. 

Therefore, it is strongly advised that you modify the list of extensions to meet the needs of your environment. Refer to https://kb.netapp.com/onprem/ontap/da/NAS/How_to_remove_a_file_extension_from_a_native_FPolicy_configuration_created_by_System_Manager_using_System_Manager_to_recreate_the_policy[How to remove a file extension from a native FPolicy configuration created by System Manager using System Manager to recreate the policy^]. 

To learn more about native FPolicy, see link:./nas-audit/fpolicy-config-types-concept.html[Fpolicy configuration types].
====

Based on best practices, these insights are displayed on one page from which you can initiate immediate actions to optimize your system. For more detail about each insight, see link:./concepts/insights-system-optimization-concept.html[System Manager insights].

== View optimization insights

.Steps

. (Optional) Filter the insights that are displayed by clicking these buttons in the upper-right corner of the page:
+
* image:icon-security-filter.gif[Security icon] Displays the security-related insights.
* image:icon-capacity-filter.gif[Capacity insights icon] Displays the capacity-related insights.
* image:icon-config-filter.gif[Configuration insights icon] Displays the configuration-related insights.
* image:icon-all-filter.png[All insights icon] Displays all of the insights.

== Respond to insights to optimize your system

In System Manager, you can respond to insights by either dismissing them, exploring different ways to remediate the problems, or initiating the process to fix the problems.

.Steps

. Hover over an insight to reveal the buttons to perform the following actions:
+
* *Dismiss*: Remove the insight from the view.  To "`undismiss`" the insight, refer to <<customize-settings-insights>>.
* *Explore*: Find out various ways to remediate the problem mentioned in the insight.  This button appears only if there is more than one method of remediation.
* *Fix*: Initiate the process of remediating the problem mentioned in the insight. You will be asked to confirm whether you want to take the action needed to apply the fix.

NOTE: Some of these actions can be initiated from other pages in System Manager, but the *Insights* page helps you streamline your day-to-day tasks by allowing you to initiate these action from this one page.
