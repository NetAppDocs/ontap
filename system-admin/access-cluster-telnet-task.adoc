= Access an ONTAP cluster using Telnet requests

[.lead]
You can issue Telnet requests to the cluster to perform administrative tasks. Telnet is disabled by default.

Telnet and RSH are not secure protocols; you should consider using SSH to access the cluster. SSH provides a secure remote shell and interactive network session. For more information, refer to link:./access-cluster-ssh-task.html[Access the cluster using SSH].

.Before you begin

The following conditions must be met before you can use Telnet to access the cluster:

* You must have a cluster local user account that is configured to use Telnet as an access method.
+
The `-application` parameter of the `security login` commands specifies the access method for a user account. Learn more about `security login` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/search.html?q=security+login[ONTAP command reference^].

.About this task

* ONTAP supports a maximum of 50 concurrent Telnet sessions per node.
+
If the cluster management LIF resides on the node, it shares this limit with the node management LIF.
+
If the rate of in-coming connections is higher than 10 per second, the service is temporarily disabled for 60 seconds.

* If you want to access the ONTAP CLI from a Windows host, you can use a third-party utility such as PuTTY.

* RSH commands require advanced privileges.

.Steps

. Confirm that the Telnet security protocol is enabled:
+
`security protocol show`

.. If the Telnet security protocol is enabled, continue to the next step.
.. If the Telnet security protocol is not enabled, use the following command to enable it:
+
`security protocol modify -application telnet -enabled true` 

. Confirm that the `management-telnet-server` service exists on the management LIFs:
+
`network interface show -services management-telnet-server`
+
Learn more about `network interface show` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/network-interface-show.html[ONTAP command reference^].

.. If the `management-telnet-server` service exists, continue to the next step.
.. If the `management-telnet-server` service does not exist, use the following command to add it:
+ 
`network interface service-policy add-service -vserver cluster1 -policy default-management -service management-telnet-server`

.ONTAP 9.9 or earlier

.Before you begin

The following conditions must be met before you can use Telnet to access the cluster:

* Telnet must already be enabled in the management firewall policy that is used by the cluster or node management LIFs so that Telnet requests can go through the firewall.
+
By default, Telnet is disabled. The `system services firewall policy show` command with the `-service telnet` parameter displays whether Telnet has been enabled in a firewall policy. Learn more about `system services firewall policy` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/search.html?q=system+services+firewall+policy[ONTAP command reference^].

* If you use IPv6 connections, IPv6 must already be configured and enabled on the cluster, and firewall policies must already be configured with IPv6 addresses.
+
The `network options ipv6 show` command displays whether IPv6 is enabled. The `system services firewall policy show` command displays firewall policies.

.Steps

. From an administration host, enter the following command:
+
`telnet hostname_or_IP`
+
`hostname_or_IP` is the host name or the IP address of the cluster management LIF or a node management LIF. Using the cluster management LIF is recommended. You can use an IPv4 or IPv6 address.

.Example of a Telnet request

The following example shows how the user named “joe”, who has been set up with Telnet access, can issue a Telnet request to access a cluster whose cluster management LIF is 10.72.137.28:

----

admin_host$ telnet 10.72.137.28

Data ONTAP
login: joe
Password:
