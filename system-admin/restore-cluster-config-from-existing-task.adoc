[.lead]
To restore a cluster configuration from an existing configuration after a cluster failure, you re-create the cluster using the cluster configuration that you chose and made available to the recovering node, and then rejoin each additional node to the new cluster.

.About this task

You should only perform this task to recover from a disaster that resulted in the loss of the cluster's configuration.

[NOTE]
====
If you are re-creating the cluster from a configuration backup file, you must contact technical support to resolve any discrepancies between the configuration backup file and the configuration present in the cluster.

If you are recovering the cluster from a configuration backup file, any configuration changes made since the backup was taken will be lost. You must resolve any discrepancies between the configuration backup file and the present configuration after recovery. See the Knowledge Base article https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Storage_Software/ONTAP_OS/ONTAP_Configuration_Backup_Resolution_Guide[ONTAP Configuration Backup Resolution Guide for troubleshooting guidance].

.Steps

. Disable storage failover for each HA pair:
+
`*storage failover modify -node _node_name_ -enabled false*`
+
You only need to disable storage failover once for each HA pair. When you disable storage failover for a node, storage failover is also disabled on the node's partner.

. Halt each node except for the recovering node:
+
`*system node halt -node _node_name_ -reason "text"*`
+
----
cluster1::*> system node halt -node node0 -reason "recovering cluster"

Warning: Are you sure you want to halt the node? {y|n}: y
----

. Set the privilege level to advanced:
+
`*set -privilege advanced*`
. On the recovering node, use the `*system configuration recovery cluster recreate*` command to re-create the cluster.
+
This example re-creates the cluster using the configuration information stored on the recovering node:
+
----
cluster1::*> configuration recovery cluster recreate -from node

Warning: This command will destroy your existing cluster. It will
         rebuild a new single-node cluster consisting of this node
         and its current configuration. This feature should only be
         used to recover from a disaster. Do not perform any other
         recovery operations while this operation is in progress.
Do you want to continue? {y|n}: y
----
+
A new cluster is created on the recovering node.

. If you are re-creating the cluster from a configuration backup file, verify that the cluster recovery is still in progress:
+
`*system configuration recovery cluster show*`
+
You do not need to verify the cluster recovery state if you are re-creating the cluster from a healthy node.
+
----
cluster1::*> system configuration recovery cluster show
 Recovery Status: in-progress
 Is Recovery Status Persisted: false
----

. Boot each node that needs to be rejoined to the re-created cluster.
+
You must reboot the nodes one at a time.

. For each node that needs to be joined to the re-created cluster, do the following:
 .. From a healthy node on the re-created cluster, rejoin the target node:
+
`*system configuration recovery cluster rejoin -node _node_name_*`
+
This example rejoins the "`node2`" target node to the re-created cluster:
+
----
cluster1::*> system configuration recovery cluster rejoin -node node2

Warning: This command will rejoin node "node2" into the local
         cluster, potentially overwriting critical cluster
         configuration files. This command should only be used
         to recover from a disaster. Do not perform any other
         recovery operations while this operation is in progress.
         This command will cause node "node2" to reboot.
Do you want to continue? {y|n}: y
----
+
The target node reboots and then joins the cluster.

 .. Verify that the target node is healthy and has formed quorum with the rest of the nodes in the cluster:
+
`*cluster show -eligibility true*`
+
The target node must rejoin the re-created cluster before you can rejoin another node.
+
----
cluster1::*> cluster show -eligibility true
Node                 Health  Eligibility   Epsilon
-------------------- ------- ------------  ------------
node0                true    true          false
node1                true    true          false
2 entries were displayed.
----
. If you re-created the cluster from a configuration backup file, set the recovery status to be complete:
+
`*system configuration recovery cluster modify -recovery-status complete*`
. Return to the admin privilege level:
+
`*set -privilege admin*`
. If the cluster consists of only two nodes, use the `*cluster ha modify*` command to reenable cluster HA.
. Use the `*storage failover modify*` command to reenable storage failover for each HA pair.

.After you finish

If the cluster has SnapMirror peer relationships, then you also need to re-create those relationships. For more information, see link:../data-protection/index.html[Data Protection].
