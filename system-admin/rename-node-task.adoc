You can change a node's name as required.

.Steps

. To rename a node, use the `system node rename` command.
+
The `-newname` parameter specifies the new name for the node. Learn more about `system node rename` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/system-node-rename.html[ONTAP command reference^].
+
If you want to rename multiple nodes in the cluster, you must run the command for each node individually.
+
[NOTE]
====
Node name cannot be "`all`" because "`all`" is a system reserved name.
====

.Example of renaming a node

The following command renames node "`node1`" to "`node1a`":

----
cluster1::> system node rename -node node1 -newname node1a
