Jobs are placed into a job queue and run in the background when resources are available. If a job is consuming too many cluster resources, you can stop it or pause it until there is less demand on the cluster. You can also monitor and restart jobs.

== Job categories

There are three categories of jobs that you can manage: server-affiliated, cluster-affiliated, and private.

A job can be in any of the following categories:

* *Server-Affiliated jobs*
+
These jobs are queued by the management framework to a specific node to be run.

* *Cluster-Affiliated jobs*
+
These jobs are queued by the management framework to any node in the cluster to be run.

* *Private jobs*
+
These jobs are specific to a node and do not use the replicated database (RDB) or any other cluster mechanism. The commands that manage private jobs require the advanced privilege level or higher.

== Commands for managing jobs

When you enter a command that invokes a job, typically, the command informs you that the job has been queued and then returns to the CLI command prompt. However, some commands instead report job progress and do not return to the CLI command prompt until the job has been completed. In these cases, you can press Ctrl-C to move the job to the background.

| If you want to...| Use this command...
a|
Display information about all jobs
a|
`job show`
a|
Display information about jobs on a per-node basis
a|
`job show bynode`
a|
Display information about cluster-affiliated jobs
a|
`job show-cluster`
a|
Display information about completed jobs
a|
`job show-completed`
a|
Display information about job history
a|
`job history show`

Up to 25,000 job records are stored for each node in the cluster. Consequently, attempting to display the full job history could take a long time. To avoid potentially long wait times, you should display jobs by node, storage virtual machine (SVM), or record ID.

a|
Display the list of private jobs
a|
`job private show` (advanced privilege level)

a|
Display information about completed private jobs
a|
`job private show-completed` (advanced privilege level)

a|
Display information about the initialization state for job managers
a|
`job initstate show` (advanced privilege level)

a|
Monitor the progress of a job
a|
`job watch-progress`
a|
Monitor the progress of a private job
a|
`job private watch-progress` (advanced privilege level)

a|
Pause a job
a|
`job pause`
a|
Pause a private job
a|
`job private pause` (advanced privilege level)

a|
Resume a paused job
a|
`job resume`
a|
Resume a paused private job
a|
`job private resume` (advanced privilege level)

a|
Stop a job
a|
`job stop`
a|
Stop a private job
a|
`job private stop` (advanced privilege level)

a|
Delete a job
a|
`job delete`
a|
Delete a private job
a|
`job private delete` (advanced privilege level)

a|
Disassociate a cluster-affiliated job with an unavailable node that owns it, so that another node can take ownership of that job
a|
`job unclaim` (advanced privilege level)

[NOTE]
====
You can use the `event log show` command to determine the outcome of a completed job. Learn more about `event log show` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/event-log-show.html[ONTAP command reference^].

== Commands for managing job schedules

Many tasks--for instance, volume snapshots--can be configured to run on specified schedules.Schedules that run at specific times are called _cron_ schedules (similar to UNIX `cron` schedules). Schedules that run at intervals are called _interval_ schedules. You use the `job schedule` commands to manage job schedules.

Job schedules do not adjust to manual changes to the cluster date and time. These jobs are scheduled to run based on the current cluster time when the job was created or when the job most recently ran. Therefore, if you manually change the cluster date or time, you should use the `job show` and `job history show` commands to verify that all scheduled jobs are queued and completed according to your requirements.

If the cluster is part of a MetroCluster configuration, then the job schedules on both clusters must be identical. Therefore, if you create, modify, or delete a job schedule, you must perform the same operation on the remote cluster.

| If you want to...| Use this command...
a|
Display information about all schedules
a|
`job schedule show`
a|
Display the list of jobs by schedule
a|
`job schedule show-jobs`
a|
Display information about cron schedules
a|
`job schedule cron show`
a|
Display information about interval schedules
a|
`job schedule interval show`
a|
Create a cron schedule
a|
`job schedule cron create`

Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can include the SVM for your job schedule.

a|
Create an interval schedule
a|
`job schedule interval create`

You must specify at least one of the following parameters: `-days`, `-hours`, `-minutes`, or `-seconds`.

a|
Modify a cron schedule
a|
`job schedule cron modify`
a|
Modify an interval schedule
a|
`job schedule interval modify`
a|
Delete a schedule
a|
`job schedule delete`
a|
Delete a cron schedule
a|
`job schedule cron delete`
a|
Delete an interval schedule
a|
`job schedule interval delete`
