Change the settings for a configuration backup schedule:

* Specify a remote URL (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, or FTPS) where the configuration backup files will be uploaded in addition to the default locations in the cluster
* Specify a user name to be used to log in to the remote URL
* Set the number of backups to keep for each configuration backup schedule

`system configuration backup settings modify`

When you use HTTPS in the remote URL, use the `-validate-certification` option to enable or disable digital certificate validation. Certificate validation is disabled by default.

The web server to which you are uploading the configuration backup file must have PUT operations enabled for HTTP and POST operations enabled for HTTPS. For more information, see your web server's documentation.
