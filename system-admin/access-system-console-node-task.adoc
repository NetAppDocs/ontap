[.lead]
If a node is hanging at the boot menu or the boot environment prompt, you can access it only through the system console (also called the _serial console_). You can access the system console of a node from an SSH connection to the node's SP or to the cluster.

.About this task

Both the SP and ONTAP offer commands that enable you to access the system console. However, from the SP, you can access only the system console of its own node. From the cluster, you can access the system console of any other node in the cluster (other than the local node).

.Steps

. Access the system console of a node:
+
[options="header"]
|===
| If you are in the...| Enter this command...
a|
SP CLI of the node
a|
`system console`
a|
ONTAP CLI
a|
`system node run-console`
|===

. Log in to the system console when you are prompted to do so.
. To exit the system console, press Ctrl-D.

.Examples of accessing the system console

The following example shows the result of entering the `system console` command at the "`SP node2`" prompt. The system console indicates that node2 is hanging at the boot environment prompt. The `boot_ontap` command is entered at the console to boot the node to ONTAP. Ctrl-D is then pressed to exit the console and return to the SP.
