Beginning with ONTAP 9.3, you can configure Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication for web services. When SAML authentication is configured and enabled, users are authenticated by an external Identity Provider (IdP) instead of the directory service providers such as Active Directory and LDAP.

== Enable SAML authentication
To enable SAML authentication with System Manager or with the CLI, perform the following steps. If your cluster is running ONTAP 9.7 or earlier, the System Manager steps you need to follow are different. Refer to the System Manager online help available on your system.

NOTE: After you enable SAML authentication, only remote users can access the System Manager GUI. Local users cannot access the System Manager GUI after SAML authentication is enabled.

.Before you begin

* The IdP that you plan to use for remote authentication must be configured.
+
[NOTE]
====
See the documentation that is provided by the IdP that you have configured.
====

* You must have the URI of the IdP.

.About this task

* SAML authentication applies only to the `http` and `ontapi` applications.
+
The `http` and `ontapi` applications are used by the following web services: Service Processor Infrastructure, ONTAP APIs, or System Manager.

* SAML authentication is applicable only for accessing the admin SVM.

The following IdPs have been validated with System Manager: 

* Active Directory Federation Services
* Cisco DUO (validated with the following ONTAP versions:)
** 9.7P21 and later 9.7 releases (refer to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-sm-classic/online-help-96-97/task_setting_up_saml_authentication.html[System Manager Classic documentation^])
** 9.8P17 and later 9.8 releases
** 9.9.1P13 and later 9.9 releases
** 9.10.1P9 and later 9.10 releases
** 9.11.1P4 and later 9.11 releases
** 9.12.1 and later releases
* Shibboleth

Perform the following steps depending on your environment:

.Steps
[role="tabbed-block"]
====
.System Manager
--
. Click *Cluster > Settings*.

. Next to *SAML Authentication*, click image:icon_gear.gif[gear icon].

. Ensure there is a check in the *Enable SAML Authentication* checkbox.

. Enter the URL of the IdP URI (including "https://").

. Modify the host system address, if needed.

. Ensure the correct certificate is being used:

* If your system was mapped with only one certificate with type "server", then that certificate is considered the default and it isn't displayed.

* If your system was mapped with multiple certificates as type "server", then one of the certificates is displayed.  To select a different certificate, click *Change*.

. Click *Save*. A confirmation window displays the metadata information, which has been automatically copied to your clipboard.

. Go to the IdP system you specified and copy the metadata from your clipboard to update the system metadata.

. Return to the confirmation window (in System Manager) and check the checkbox *I have configured the IdP with the host URI or metadata*.

. Click *Logout* to enable SAML-based authentication.  The IdP system will display an authentication screen.

. In the IdP system, enter your SAML-based credentials. After your credentials are verified, you will be directed to the System Manager home page.
--

.CLI
--
. Create a SAML configuration so that ONTAP can access the IdP metadata:
+
`*security saml-sp create -idp-uri _idp_uri_ -sp-host _ontap_host_name_*`
+
`idp_uri` is the FTP or HTTP address of the IdP host from where the IdP metadata can be downloaded.
+
`ontap_host_name` is the host name or IP address of the SAML service provider host, which in this case is the ONTAP system. By default, the IP address of the cluster-management LIF is used.
+
You can optionally provide the ONTAP server certificate information. By default, the ONTAP web server certificate information is used.

https://10.0.0.1/saml-sp/Metadata

Configure the IdP and Data ONTAP users for the same directory server domain to ensure that users are the same for different authentication methods. See the "security login show" command for the Data ONTAP user configuration.
----
+
The URL to access the ONTAP host metadata is displayed.

. From the IdP host, configure the IdP with the ONTAP host metadata.
+
For more information about configuring the IdP, see the IdP documentation.

. Enable SAML configuration:
+
`*security saml-sp modify -is-enabled true*`
+
Any existing user that accesses the `http` or `ontapi` application is automatically configured for SAML authentication.

. If you want to create users for the `http` or `ontapi` application after SAML is configured, specify SAML as the authentication method for the new users.
 .. Create a login method for new users with SAML authentication:
 +
 `*security login create -user-or-group-name _user_name_ -application [http | ontapi] -authentication-method saml -vserver _svm_name_*`
+
----
cluster_12::> security login create -user-or-group-name admin1 -application http -authentication-method saml -vserver  cluster_12

 .. Verify that the user entry is created:

`*security login show*`

== Disable SAML authentication

You can disable SAML authentication when you want to stop authenticating web users by using an external Identity Provider (IdP). When SAML authentication is disabled, the configured directory service providers such as Active Directory and LDAP are used for authentication.

// .What you'll need

// You must be logged in from the console.

Perform the following steps depending on your environment:

.Steps
[role="tabbed-block"]
====
.System Manager
--
. Click *Cluster > Settings*.

. Under *SAML Authentication*, click the *Enabled* toggle button.

. _Optional_:  You can also click  image:icon_gear.gif[gear icon] next to *SAML Authentication*, and then uncheck the *Enable SAML Authentication* checkbox.
--

.CLI
--
. Disable SAML authentication:
+
`*security saml-sp modify -is-enabled false*`
. If you no longer want to use SAML authentication or if you want to modify the IdP, delete the SAML configuration:
+
`*security saml-sp delete*`
--
====

== Troubleshoot issues with SAML configuration

If configuring Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication fails, you can manually repair each node on which the SAML configuration failed and recover from the failure. During the repair process, the web server is restarted and any active HTTP connections or HTTPS connections are disrupted.

.About this task

When you configure SAML authentication, ONTAP applies SAML configuration on a per-node basis. When you enable SAML authentication, ONTAP automatically tries to repair each node if there are configuration issues. If there are issues with SAML configuration on any node, you can disable SAML authentication and then reenable SAML authentication. There can be situations when SAML configuration fails to apply on one or more nodes even after you reenable SAML authentication. You can identify the node on which SAML configuration has failed and then manually repair that node.

.Steps

. Log in to the advanced privilege level:
+
`*set -privilege advanced*`
. Identify the node on which SAML configuration failed:
+
`*security saml-sp status show -instance*`
+
