[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.3, you can configure Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication for web services. When SAML authentication is configured and enabled, users are authenticated by an external Identity Provider (IdP) instead of the directory service providers such as Active Directory and LDAP. When SAML authentication is disabled, the configured directory service providers such as Active Directory and LDAP are used for authentication

== Enable SAML authentication
To enable SAML authentication with System Manager or with the CLI, perform the following steps. If your cluster is running ONTAP 9.7 or earlier, the System Manager steps you need to follow are different. Refer to the System Manager online help available on your system.

NOTE: After you enable SAML authentication, only remote users configured for SAML authentication can access the System Manager GUI. Local users cannot access the System Manager GUI after SAML authentication is enabled.

image:workflow_security_mfa_setup.gif[Workflow of the task to set up multifactor authentication with SAML]

.Before you begin

* The IdP that you plan to use for remote authentication must be <<Configure third-party IdP, configured>>. You must have the URI of the IdP. The IdP URI is the web address of the IdP, which System Manager uses to send authentication requests and receive responses.

* Port 443 must be open between the ONTAP cluster and the IdP.

* The ONTAP cluster and the IdP must each be able to ping the other's fully qualified domain name. Ensure DNS is properly configured and the cluster certificate is not expired.

* You must be able to access the Remote LAN Module (RLM) or the link:/system-admin/sp-concept.html[Service Processor (SP)] of the ONTAP cluster. If SAML is misconfigured, you will need to disable it from the RLM or SP.

* You must create SAML users the `http` or `ontapi` application prior to enabling SAML authentication. You can create users with the `security login create` command. The users must be configured for SAML authentication. For more information, see the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/security-login-create.html[ONTAP command reference^].
//todo: check procedure for adding SAML to existing users
.. Create a login method for new users with SAML authentication:

Perform the following steps depending on your environment:

.Steps
[role="tabbed-block"]
====
.System Manager
--
. Click *Cluster > Settings*.

. Next to *SAML Authentication*, click image:icon_gear.gif[Actions icon].

. Ensure there is a check in the *Enable SAML Authentication* checkbox.

. Enter the URL of the IdP URI (including "https://").

. Modify the host system address, if needed.

. Ensure the correct certificate is being used:

* If your system was mapped with only one certificate with type "server", then that certificate is considered the default and it isn't displayed.

* If your system was mapped with multiple certificates as type "server", then one of the certificates is displayed.  To select a different certificate, click *Change*.

. Click *Save*. A confirmation window displays the metadata information, which has been automatically copied to your clipboard.

. Go to the IdP system you specified and copy the metadata from your clipboard to update the system metadata.

. Return to the confirmation window (in System Manager) and check the checkbox *I have configured the IdP with the host URI or metadata*.

. Click *Logout* to enable SAML-based authentication.  The IdP system will display an authentication screen.

. In the IdP sign-on page, enter your SAML-based credentials. After your credentials are verified, you will be directed to the System Manager home page.
--

.CLI
--
. Create a SAML configuration so that ONTAP can access the IdP metadata:
+
`security saml-sp create -idp-uri <idp_uri> -sp-host <ontap_host_name>`
+
`idp_uri` is the FTP or HTTP address of the IdP host from where the IdP metadata can be downloaded. 
+
NOTE: The question mark (`?`) activates the command line active help. In order to enter a question mark as part of a URI, it is necessary to disable active help with the command `set -active-help false`. Active help can later be re-enabled with the command `set -active-help true`. Learn more about `set` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/set.html[ONTAP command reference^].
+
`ontap_host_name` is the host name or IP address of the SAML service provider host, which in this case is the ONTAP system. By default, the IP address of the cluster-management LIF is used.
+
You can optionally provide the ONTAP server certificate information. By default, the ONTAP web server certificate information is used.

== Disable SAML authentication

You can disable SAML authentication when you want to stop authenticating remote users by using an external Identity Provider (IdP). When SAML authentication is disabled, local user authentication or the configured directory service providers such as Active Directory and LDAP are used to authenticate users.

// .What you'll need

// You must be logged in from the console.

== Troubleshoot issues with SAML configuration

If configuring Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication fails, you can manually repair each node on which the SAML configuration failed and recover from the failure. During the repair process, the web server is restarted and any active HTTP connections or HTTPS connections are disrupted.

.About this task

When you configure SAML authentication, ONTAP applies SAML configuration on a per-node basis. When you enable SAML authentication, ONTAP automatically tries to repair each node if there are configuration issues. If there are issues with SAML configuration on any node, you can disable SAML authentication and then reenable SAML authentication. There can be situations when SAML configuration fails to apply on one or more nodes even after you reenable SAML authentication. You can identify the node on which SAML configuration has failed and then manually repair that node.

.Steps

. Log in to the advanced privilege level:
+
`set -privilege advanced`
. Identify the node on which SAML configuration failed:
+
`security saml-sp status show -instance`
+
Example:
+
----
cluster_12::*> security saml-sp status show -instance

                         Node: node1
