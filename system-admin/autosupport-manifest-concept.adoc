The AutoSupport manifest provides you with a detailed view of the files collected for each AutoSupport message. The AutoSupport manifest also includes information about collection errors when AutoSupport cannot collect the files it needs.

The AutoSupport manifest includes the following information:

* Sequence number of the AutoSupport message
* Which files AutoSupport included in the AutoSupport message
* Size of each file, in bytes
* Status of the AutoSupport manifest collection
* Error description, if AutoSupport failed to collect one or more files

You can view the AutoSupport manifest by using the `system node autosupport manifest show` command.

The AutoSupport manifest is included with every AutoSupport message and presented in XML format, which means that you can either use a generic XML viewer to read it or view it using the Digital Advisor portal.
