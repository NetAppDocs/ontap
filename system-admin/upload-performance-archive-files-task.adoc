[.lead]
You can generate and send an AutoSupport message that contains a performance archive. By default, NetApp technical support receives the AutoSupport message, and the performance archive is uploaded to the NetApp support site. You can specify an alternate destination for the message and upload.

.What you'll need

* You must have set up AutoSupport with the following settings:
 ** AutoSupport is enabled on the node.
 ** AutoSupport is configured to send messages to technical support.
 ** AutoSupport is configured to use the HTTP or HTTPS transport protocol.
+
The SMTP transport protocol is not supported when sending messages that include large files, such as performance archive files.

.About this task

You must specify a start date for the performance archive data that you want to upload. Most storage systems retain performance archives for two weeks, enabling you to specify a start date up to two weeks ago. For example, if today is January 15, you can specify a start date of January 2.

.Step

. Generate an AutoSupport message and upload the performance archive file by using the `system node autosupport invoke-performance-archive` command.
+
In the following example, 4 hours of performance archive files from January 12, 2015 are added to an AutoSupport message and uploaded to the default location, which is the NetApp support site:
