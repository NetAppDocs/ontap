[.lead]
You can administer ONTAP systems with the command-line interface (CLI). You can use the ONTAP management interfaces, access the cluster, manage nodes, and much more.

You should use these procedures under the following circumstances:

* You want to understand the range of ONTAP administrator capabilities.
* You want to use the CLI, not System Manager or an automated scripting tool.
