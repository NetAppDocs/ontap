Many tasks--for instance, volume Snapshot copies--can be configured to run on specified schedules.Schedules that run at specific times are called _cron_ schedules (similar to UNIX `cron` schedules). Schedules that run at intervals are called _interval_ schedules. You use the `job schedule` commands to manage job schedules.

Job schedules do not adjust to manual changes to the cluster date and time. These jobs are scheduled to run based on the current cluster time when the job was created or when the job most recently ran. Therefore, if you manually change the cluster date or time, you should use the `job show` and `job history show` commands to verify that all scheduled jobs are queued and completed according to your requirements.

If the cluster is part of a MetroCluster configuration, then the job schedules on both clusters must be identical. Therefore, if you create, modify, or delete a job schedule, you must perform the same operation on the remote cluster.
