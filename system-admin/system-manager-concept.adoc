System Manager is a graphical management interface that enables you to manage storage systems and storage objects (such as disks, volumes, and aggregates) and perform common management tasks related to storage systems from a web browser. As a cluster administrator, you can use System Manager to administer the entire cluster and its resources.

[NOTE]
====
System Manager is no longer available as an executable file and is now included with ONTAP software as a web service, enabled by default, and accessible by using a browser.

[NOTE]
====
The name of System Manager has changed from previous versions. Versions 9.5 and earlier were named OnCommand System Manager. Versions 9.6 and later are now called System Manager.

System Manager enables you to perform many common tasks such as the following:

* Create a cluster, configure a network, and set up support details for the cluster.
* Configure and manage storage objects such as disks, aggregates, volumes, qtrees, and quotas.
* Configure protocols such as CIFS and NFS, and provision file sharing.
* Configure protocols such as FC, FCoE, NVMe, and iSCSI for block access.
* Create and configure network components such as subnets, broadcast domains, data and management interfaces, and interface groups.
* Set up and manage mirroring and vaulting relationships.
* Perform cluster management, storage node management, and storage virtual machine (SVM) management operations.
* Create and configure SVMs, manage storage objects associated with SVMs, and manage SVM services.
* Monitor and manage HA configurations in a cluster.
* Configure Service Processors to remotely log in, manage, monitor, and administer the node, regardless of the state of the node.
