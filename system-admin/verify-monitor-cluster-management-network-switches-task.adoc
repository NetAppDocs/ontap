The cluster switch health monitor automatically attempts to monitor the switches that it discovers; however, monitoring might not happen automatically if the switches are not configured correctly. You should verify that the health monitor is properly configured to monitor your switches.

.Steps

. Use the `system health cluster-switch show` command to identify the switches that the cluster switch health monitor discovered.
+
If the `Model` column displays the value `OTHER`, then ONTAP cannot monitor the switch. ONTAP sets the value to `OTHER` if a switch that it automatically discovers is not supported for health monitoring.
+
[NOTE]
====
If a switch does not display in the command output, then you must configure discovery of the switch.
====

. Upgrade to the latest supported switch software and reference the configuration file (RCF) from the NetApp Support Site.

+
The community string in the switch's RCF must match the community string that the health monitor is configured to use. By default, the health monitor uses the community string `cshm1!`.
+
If you need to change information about a switch that the cluster monitors, you can modify the community string that the health monitor uses by using the `system health cluster-switch modify` command.

. Verify that the switch's management port is connected to the management network.
+
This connection is required to perform SNMP queries.
