Configuring access to web services allows authorized users to use HTTP or HTTPS to access the service content on the cluster or a storage virtual machine (SVM).

.Steps

. If a firewall is enabled, ensure that HTTP or HTTPS access is set up in the firewall policy for the LIF that will be used for web services:
+
[NOTE]
====
You can check whether a firewall is enabled by using the `system services firewall show` command.
====

 .. To verify that HTTP or HTTPS is set up in the firewall policy, use the `system services firewall policy show` command.
+
You set the `-service` parameter of the `system services firewall policy create` command to `http` or `https` to enable the policy to support web access.

 .. To verify that the firewall policy supporting HTTP or HTTPS is associated with the LIF that provides web services, use the `network interface show` command with the `-firewall-policy` parameter.
+
You use the `network interface modify` command with the `-firewall-policy` parameter to put the firewall policy into effect for a LIF.
+
Learn more about `network interface modify` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/network-interface-modify.html[ONTAP command reference^].

. To configure the cluster-level web protocol engine and make web service content accessible, use the `system services web modify` command.
. If you plan to use secure web services (HTTPS), enable SSL and provide digital certificate information for the cluster or SVM by using the `security ssl modify` command.
. To enable a web service for the cluster or SVM, use the `vserver services web modify` command.
+
You must repeat this step for each service that you want to enable for the cluster or SVM.

. To authorize a role to access web services on the cluster or SVM, use the `vserver services web access create` command.
+
The role that you grant access must already exist. You can display existing roles by using the `security login role show` command or create new roles by using the `security login role create` command.

. For a role that has been authorized to access a web service, ensure that its users are also configured with the correct access method by checking the output of the `security login show` command.
+
To access the ONTAP API web service (`ontapi`), a user must be configured with the `ontapi` access method. To access all other web services, a user must be configured with the `http` access method.
+
[NOTE]
====
You use the `security login create` command to add an access method for a user.
