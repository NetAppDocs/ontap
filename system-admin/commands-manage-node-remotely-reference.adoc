[.lead]
You can manage a node remotely to perform node-management tasks by accessing its SP and running SP CLI commands, or accessing the BMC and running BMC CLI commands. For several commonly performed remote node-management tasks, you can also use ONTAP commands from another node in the cluster. Some SP and BMC commands are platform-specific and might not be available on your platform.

Certain command types can be used in both SP and BMC command sets. The differences between them will be shown when entering the command line.

.Examples
* The `help` command in SP: `SP> help`
* The `help` command in BMC: `BMC> help`

Learn more about the `help` command options available for SP and BMC in link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/online-help-at-sp-bmc-cli-task.html[View the help information in the ONTAP SP/BMC CLI^].

Learn more about corresponding ONTAP BMC CLI in link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/bmc-cli-commands-reference.html[Supported CLI commands for the ONTAP Baseboard Management Controller^].

Turn the node on or off, or perform a power-cycle (turning the power off and then back on)
a|
`system power` `on`

3+a|
The standby power stays on to keep the SP running without interruption. During the power-cycle, a brief pause occurs before power is turned back on.

[NOTE]
====
Using these commands to turn off or power-cycle the node might cause an improper shutdown of the node (also called a _dirty shutdown_) and is not a substitute for a graceful shutdown using the ONTAP `system node halt` command.
====

.2+a|
Create a core dump and reset the node
a|
`system core` [`-f`]

The `-f` option forces the creation of a core dump and the reset of the node.

a|
`system core`
a|
`system node coredump trigger`

(advanced privilege level)

3+a|
These commands have the same effect as pressing the Non-maskable Interrupt (NMI) button on a node, causing a dirty shutdown of the node and forcing a dump of the core files when halting the node. These commands are helpful when ONTAP on the node is hung or does not respond to commands such as `system node shutdown`. The generated core dump files are displayed in the output of the `system node coredump show` command. The SP stays operational as long as the input power to the node is not interrupted.

.2+a|
Reboot the node with an optionally specified BIOS firmware image (primary, backup, or current) to recover from issues such as a corrupted image of the node's boot device
a|
`system reset` 

{`primary` \| `backup` \| `current`}
a|
`system reset` 

{ `current` \| `primary` \| `backup` }
a|
`system node reset` with the `-firmware` {`primary` \| `backup` \| `current`} parameter

(advanced privilege level)


3+a|

[NOTE]
====
This operation causes a dirty shutdown of the node.
====

If no BIOS firmware image is specified, the current image is used for the reboot. The SP stays operational as long as the input power to the node is not interrupted.
