You can manage a node remotely by accessing its SP and running SP CLI commands to perform node-management tasks. For several commonly performed remote node-management tasks, you can also use ONTAP commands from another node in the cluster. Some SP commands are platform-specific and might not be available on your platform.

a|
`system fru log show` (advanced privilege level)

a|

a|

a|
Display the status for the environmental sensors, including their states and current values
a|
`system sensors` or `system sensors show`
a|

a|
`system node environment sensors show`
a|
Display the status and details for the specified sensor
a|
`system sensors get` `sensor_name`

You can obtain `sensor_name` by using the `system sensors` or the `system sensors show` command.

a|

a|

a|
Display the SP firmware version information
a|
`version`
a|

a|

a|

a|

.2+a|
Log in to the system console
a|
`system console`
a|

a|
`system node run-console`
3+a|
You should press Ctrl-D to exit the system console session.

.4+a|
Turn the node on or off, or perform a power-cycle (turning the power off and then back on)
a|
`system power` `on`
a|

a|
`system node power on` (advanced privilege level)

a|
`system power` `off`
a|

a|

a|
`system power` `cycle`
a|

a|

3+a|
The standby power stays on to keep the SP running without interruption. During the power-cycle, a brief pause occurs before power is turned back on.

[NOTE]
====
Using these commands to turn off or power-cycle the node might cause an improper shutdown of the node (also called a _dirty shutdown_) and is not a substitute for a graceful shutdown using the ONTAP `system node halt` command.
====

.2+a|
Create a core dump and reset the node
a|
`system core` [`-f`]

The `-f` option forces the creation of a core dump and the reset of the node.

a|

a|
`system node coredump trigger`

(advanced privilege level)

3+a|
These commands have the same effect as pressing the Non-maskable Interrupt (NMI) button on a node, causing a dirty shutdown of the node and forcing a dump of the core files when halting the node. These commands are helpful when ONTAP on the node is hung or does not respond to commands such as `system node shutdown`. The generated core dump files are displayed in the output of the `system node coredump show` command. The SP stays operational as long as the input power to the node is not interrupted.

.2+a|
Reboot the node with an optionally specified BIOS firmware image (primary, backup, or current) to recover from issues such as a corrupted image of the node's boot device
a|
`system reset` {`primary` \| `backup` \| `current`}
a|

a|
`system node reset` with the `-firmware` {`primary` \| `backup` \| `current`} parameter(advanced privilege level)

`system node reset`

3+a|

[NOTE]
====
This operation causes a dirty shutdown of the node.
====

If no BIOS firmware image is specified, the current image is used for the reboot. The SP stays operational as long as the input power to the node is not interrupted.

a|
Display the status of battery firmware automatic update, or enable or disable battery firmware automatic update upon next SP boot
a|
`system battery auto_update` [`status` \| `enable` \| `disable`]

(advanced privilege level)

a|

a|

a|
Compare the current battery firmware image against a specified firmware image
a|
`system battery verify` [`image_URL`]

(advanced privilege level)

If `image_URL` is not specified, the default battery firmware image is used for comparison.

a|

a|

a|
Update the battery firmware from the image at the specified location
a|
`system battery flash` `image_URL`

(advanced privilege level)

You use this command if the automatic battery firmware upgrade process has failed for some reason.

a|

a|

a|
Update the SP firmware by using the image at the specified location
a|
`sp update` `image_URL image_URL` must not exceed 200 characters.

a|
`bmc update` `image_URL image_URL` must not exceed 200 characters.

a|
`system service-processor image update`

a| Reboot the SP
a| `sp reboot`
a|
a| `system service-processor reboot-sp`

a| Erase the NVRAM flash content
a|
`system nvram flash clear` (advanced privilege level)

This command cannot be initiated when the controller power is off (`system power off`).

a|

a|

a|
Exit the SP CLI
a|
`exit`
a|
