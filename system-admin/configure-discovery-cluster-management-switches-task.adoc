The cluster switch health monitor automatically attempts to discover your cluster and management network switches using the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP). You must configure the health monitor if it cannot automatically discover a switch or if you do not want to use CDP for automatic discovery.

.About this task

The `system cluster-switch show` command lists the switches that the health monitor discovered. If you do not see a switch that you expected to see in that list, then the health monitor cannot automatically discover it.

.Steps

. If you want to use CDP for automatic discovery, do the following:
 .. Ensure that the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is enabled on your switches.
+
Refer to your switch documentation for instructions.

 .. Run the following command on each node in the cluster to verify whether CDP is enabled or disabled:
+
`*run -node _node_name_ -command options cdpd.enable*`
+
If CDP is enabled, go to step d. If CDP is disabled, go to step c.

 .. Run the following command to enable CDP:
+
`*run -node _node_name_ -command options cdpd.enable on*`
+
Wait five minutes before you go to the next step.

 .. Use the `system cluster-switch show` command to verify whether ONTAP can now automatically discover the switches.
. If the health monitor cannot automatically discover a switch, use the `system cluster-switch create` command to configure discovery of the switch:
+
----
cluster1::> system cluster-switch create -device switch1 -address 192.0.2.250 -snmp-version SNMPv2c -community cshm1! -model NX5020 -type cluster-network
----
+
Wait five minutes before you go to the next step.

. Use the `system cluster-switch show` command to verify that ONTAP can discover the switch for which you added information.

.After you finish

Verify that the health monitor can monitor your switches.
