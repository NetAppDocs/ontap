You can remove unwanted nodes from a cluster, one node at a time. After you remove a node, you must also remove its failover partner. If you are removing a node, then its data becomes inaccessible or erased.

.Before you begin

You must satisfy the following conditions before you remove nodes from the cluster:

* More than half of the nodes in the cluster must be healthy.

* All data, volumes, and non-root aggregates must be relocated or removed from the node.

** All of the data on the node that you want to remove must have been evacuated. This might include link:../encryption-at-rest/secure-purge-data-encrypted-volume-concept.html[purging data from an encrypted volume].

** All non-root volumes have been link:../volumes/move-volume-task.html[moved] from aggregates owned by the node.

** All non-root aggregates have been link:../disks-aggregates/commands-manage-aggregates-reference.html[deleted] from the node.

* All LIFs and VLANs have been relocated or removed from the node.

** Data LIFs have been link:../networking/delete_a_lif.html[deleted] or link:../networking/migrate_a_lif.html[relocated] from the node.

** Cluster management LIFs have been link:../networking/migrate_a_lif.html[relocated] from the node and the home ports changed.

** All intercluster LIFs have been link:../networking/delete_a_lif.html[removed]. When you remove intercluster LIFs a warning is displayed that can be ignored.

** All VLANs on the node have been link:../networking/configure_vlans_over_physical_ports.html#delete-a-vlan[deleted].

* The node is not participating in any failover relationships.

** Storage failover has been link:../high-availability/ha_commands_for_enabling_and_disabling_storage_failover.html[disabled] for the node.

** All LIF failover rules have been link:../networking/commands_for_managing_failover_groups_and_policies.html[modified] to remove ports on the node.

* If the node owns Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) disks or self-encrypting disks (SEDs), link:../encryption-at-rest/return-seds-unprotected-mode-task.html[disk encryption has been removed] by returning the disks to unprotected mode.
** You might also want to link:../encryption-at-rest/sanitize-fips-drive-sed-task.html[sanitize FIPS drives or SEDs].

* If you have LUNs on the node to be removed, you should link:../san-admin/modify-slm-reporting-nodes-task.html[modify the Selective LUN Map (SLM) reporting-nodes list] before you remove the node.
+
If you do not remove the node and its HA partner from the SLM reporting-nodes list, access to the LUNs previously on the node can be lost even though the volumes containing the LUNs were moved to another node.

It is recommended that you issue an AutoSupport message to notify NetApp technical support that node removal is underway.

IMPORTANT: Do not perform operations such as `cluster remove-node`, `cluster unjoin`, and `node rename` when an automated ONTAP upgrade is in progress.

.About this task

* If you are running a mixed-version cluster, you can remove the last low-version node by using one of the advanced privilege commands beginning with ONTAP 9.3:

** ONTAP 9.3: `cluster unjoin -skip-last-low-version-node-check`
** ONTAP 9.4 and later: `cluster remove-node -skip-last-low-version-node-check`

* If you remove two nodes from a four-node cluster, cluster HA is automatically enabled on the two remaining nodes.

NOTE: All system and user data, from all disks that are connected to the node, must be made inaccessible to users before removing a node from the cluster. If a node was incorrectly removed from a cluster, contact NetApp Support for assistance with options for recovery.

. Repeat Steps <<disable-ha,1>> to <<return-admin,9>> to remove the failover partner from the cluster.
