 .. Use the `system configuration backup show` command at the advanced privilege level to view the list of configuration backup files available in the cluster that contains the recovering node's configuration.

If you previously re-created the cluster, you should choose a configuration backup file that was created after the cluster recreation. If you must use a configuration backup file that was created prior to the cluster recreation, then after recovering the node, you must re-create the cluster again.
