You can set display preferences for a CLI session by using the `set` command and `rows` command. The preferences you set apply only to the session you are in. They are not persistent across sessions.

.About this task

You can set the following CLI display preferences:

* The privilege level of the command session
* Whether confirmations are issued for potentially disruptive commands
* Whether `show` commands display all fields
* The character or characters to use as the field separator
* The default unit when reporting data sizes
* The number of rows the screen displays in the current CLI session before the interface pauses output
+
If the preferred number of rows is not specified, it is automatically adjusted based on the actual height of the terminal. If the actual height is undefined, the default number of rows is 24.

* The default storage virtual machine (SVM) or node
* Whether a continuing command should stop if it encounters an error

.Steps

. To set CLI display preferences, use the `set` command.
+
To set the number of rows the screen displays in the current CLI session, you can also use the `rows` command.

.Example of setting display preferences in the CLI
