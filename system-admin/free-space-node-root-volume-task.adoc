A warning message appears when a node's root volume has become full or almost full. The node cannot operate properly when its root volume is full. You can free up space on a node's root volume by deleting core dump files, packet trace files, and root volume Snapshot copies.

.Steps

. Display the node's core dump files and their names by using the `system node coredump show` command.
. Delete unwanted core dump files from the node by using the `system node coredump delete` command.
. Access the nodeshell:
+
`*system node run -node _nodename_*`
+
`_nodename_` is the name of the node whose root volume space you want to free up.

. Switch to the nodeshell advanced privilege level from the nodeshell:
+
`*priv set advanced*`

. Display and delete the node's packet trace files through the nodeshell:
.. Display all files in the node's root volume:
+
`*ls /etc*`
.. If any packet trace files (`*.trc`) are in the node's root volume, delete them individually:
+
`*rm /etc/log/packet_traces/_file_name.trc_*`

. Identify and delete the node's root volume Snapshot copies through the nodeshell:

.. Identify the root volume name:
+
`*vol status*`
+
The root volume is indicated by the word "`root`" in the "`Options`" column of the `vol status` command output.
+
In the following example, the root volume is `vol0`:
+
----
node1*> vol status

         Volume State           Status            Options
           vol0 online          raid_dp, flex     root, nvfail=on
                                64-bit
----

.. Display root volume Snapshot copies:
+
`*snap list root_vol_name*`

.. Delete unwanted root volume Snapshot copies:
+
`*snap delete root_vol_namesnapshot_name*`

. Exit the nodeshell and return to the clustershell:
+
`*exit*`
