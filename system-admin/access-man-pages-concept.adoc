ONTAP manual (man) pages explain how to use ONTAP CLI commands. These pages are available at the command line and are also published in release-specific _command references_.

At the ONTAP command line, use the `man _command_name_` command to display the manual page of the specified command. If you do not specify a command name, the manual page index is displayed. You can use the `man man` command to view information about the `man` command itself. You can exit a man page by entering `*q*`.

Learn more about the admin-level and advanced-level ONTAP commands available in your release in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/[ONTAP command reference^].
