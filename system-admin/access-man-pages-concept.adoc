ONTAP manual (man) pages explain how to use ONTAP CLI commands. These pages are available at the command line and are also published in release-specific _command references_.

At the ONTAP command line, use the `man _command_name_` command to display the manual page of the specified command. If you do not specify a command name, the manual page index is displayed. You can use the `man man` command to view information about the `man` command itself. You can exit a man page by entering `*q*`.

Refer to the xref:../concepts/manual-pages.html[command reference for your version of ONTAP 9] to learn about the admin-level and advanced-level ONTAP commands available in your release.
