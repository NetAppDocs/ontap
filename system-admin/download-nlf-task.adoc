If your system is running ONTAP 9.10.1 or later, you can upgrade the bundle license files on existing systems by downloading the NLF for ONTAP One or ONTAP Core from the NetApp Support Site.  

[NOTE]
The SnapMirror cloud and SnapMirror S3 licenses are not included with ONTAP One. They are part of the ONTAP One Compatibility bundle, which you can get for free if you have ONTAP One and link:../data-protection/install-snapmirror-cloud-license-task.html[request separately].

.Steps

You can download ONTAP One license files for systems with existing NetApp license file bundles and for systems with 28-character license keys that have been converted to NetApp license files on systems running ONTAP 9.10.1 and later. For a fee, you can also upgrade systems from ONTAP Base to ONTAP One.
