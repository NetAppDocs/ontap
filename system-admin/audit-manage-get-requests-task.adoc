While SET requests are logged by default, GET requests are not. However, you can control whether GET requests sent from ONTAP HTML (`-httpget`), the ONTAP CLI (`-cliget`), or from the ONTAP APIs (`-ontapiget`) are logged in the file.

You can modify audit logging settings from the ONTAP CLI, and beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, from System Manager.
