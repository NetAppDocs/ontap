You can record a CLI session into a file with a specified name and size limit, then upload the file to an FTP or HTTP destination. You can also display or delete files in which you previously recorded CLI sessions.

== Record a CLI session

A record of a CLI session ends when you stop the recording or end the CLI session, or when the file reaches the specified size limit. The default file size limit is 1 MB. The maximum file size limit is 2 GB.

Recording a CLI session is useful, for example, if you are troubleshooting an issue and want to save detailed information or if you want to create a permanent record of space usage at a specific point in time.


.Steps

. Start recording the current CLI session into a file:
+
[source,cli]
----
system script start
----
+
Learn more about `system script start` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/system-script-start.html[ONTAP command reference^].
+
ONTAP starts recording your CLI session into the specified file.

. Proceed with your CLI session.
. When finished, stop recording the session:
+
[source,cli]
----
system script stop
----
+
Learn more about `system script stop` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/system-script-stop.html[ONTAP command reference^].
+
ONTAP stops recording your CLI session.

== Commands for managing the automatic timeout period of CLI sessions

The timeout value specifies how long a CLI session remains idle before being automatically terminated. The CLI timeout value is cluster-wide. That is, every node in a cluster uses the same CLI timeout value.

By default, the automatic timeout period of CLI sessions is 30 minutes.

You use the `system timeout` commands to manage the automatic timeout period of CLI sessions.
