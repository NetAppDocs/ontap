System volumes are FlexVol volumes that contain special metadata, such as metadata for file services audit logs. These volumes are visible in the cluster so that you can fully account for storage use in your cluster.

System volumes are owned by the cluster management server (also called the admin SVM), and they are created automatically when file services auditing is enabled.

You can view system volumes by using the `volume show` command, but most other volume operations are not permitted. For example, you cannot modify a system volume by using the `volume modify` command.

This example shows four system volumes on the admin SVM, which were automatically created when file services auditing was enabled for a data SVM in the cluster:
