You can configure an ONTAP cluster to deliver AutoSupport messages to NetApp technical support and send email copies to your internal support organization. As part of this, you can also test the configuration before using it in a production environment.

.About this task

Beginning with ONTAP 9.5, you enable and configure AutoSupport for all nodes of a cluster simultaneously. When a new node joins the cluster, the node automatically inherits the same AutoSupport configuration. To support this, the scope of the CLI command `system node autosupport modify` is cluster-level. The `-node` command option is retained for backward compatibility, but it is ignored.

[NOTE]
In ONTAP 9.4 and earlier releases, the command `system node autosupport modify` is specific to each node. If your cluster is running ONTAP 9.4 or earlier, you need to enable and configure AutoSupport on each node in the cluster.

.Before you begin

The recommended transport configuration for delivering AutoSupport messages to NetApp is HTTPS (HTTP with TLS). This option provides the most robust features and best security.

Review link:requirements-autosupport-reference.html[Prepare to use AutoSupport] for more information before configuring your ONTAP cluster.

.Steps

. Ensure that AutoSupport is enabled:
+
----
system node autosupport modify -state enable
----

. If you want NetApp technical support to receive AutoSupport messages, use the following command:
+
----
system node autosupport modify -support enable
----
+
You must enable this option if you want to enable AutoSupport to work with AutoSupport OnDemand or if you want to upload large files, such as core dump and performance archive files, to technical support or a specified URL.

. If NetApp technical support is enabled to receive AutoSupport messages, specify which transport protocol to use for the messages.
+
You can choose from the following options:
+

|===

h| If you want to... h| Then set the following parameters of the `system node autosupport modify` command...

a|
Use the default HTTPS protocol
a|

 .. Set `-transport` to `https`.
 .. If you use a proxy, set `-proxy-url` to the URL of your proxy.
 This configuration supports communication with AutoSupport OnDemand and uploads of large files.

a|
Use SMTP
a|
Set `-transport` to `smtp`.

This configuration does not support AutoSupport OnDemand or uploads of large files.

|===

. If you want your internal support organization or a support partner to receive AutoSupport messages, perform the following actions:
 .. Identify the recipients in your organization by setting the following parameters of the `system node autosupport modify` command:
+

|===

h| Set this parameter... h| To this...

a|
`-to`
a|
Up to five comma-separated individual email addresses or distribution lists in your internal support organization that will receive key AutoSupport messages
a|
`-noteto`
a|
Up to five comma-separated individual email addresses or distribution lists in your internal support organization that will receive a shortened version of key AutoSupport messages designed for cell phones and other mobile devices
a|
`-partner-address`
a|
Up to five comma-separated individual email addresses or distribution lists in your support partner organization that will receive all AutoSupport messages
|===

.. Check that addresses are correctly configured by listing the destinations using the `system node autosupport destinations show` command.

. If you are sending messages to your internal support organization or you chose SMTP transport for messages to technical support, configure SMTP by setting the following parameters of the `system node autosupport modify` command:
 ** Set `-mail-hosts` to one or more mail hosts, separated by commas.
+
You can set a maximum of five.
+
You can configure a port value for each mail host by specifying a colon and port number after the mail host name: for example, `mymailhost.example.com:5678`, where 5678 is the port for the mail host.

 ** Set `-from` to the email address that sends the AutoSupport message.
. Configure DNS.
. Optionally, add command options if you want to change specific settings:
+

|===

h| If you want to do this... h| Then set the following parameters of the `system node autosupport modify` command...

a|
Hide private data by removing, masking, or encoding sensitive data in the messages
a|
Set `-remove-private-data` to `true`. If you change from `false` to `true`, all AutoSupport history and all associated files are deleted.
a|
Stop sending performance data in periodic AutoSupport messages
a|
Set `-perf` to `false`.
|===

. If you are using SMTP to deliver AutoSupport messages to NetApp, you can optionally enable TLS for improved security.
.. Display the values available for the new parameter:
+
----
cluster1::> system node autosupport modify -smtp-encryption ?
----
.. Enable TLS for SMTP message delivery:
+
----
cluster1::> system node autosupport modify -smtp-encryption start_tls
----
.. Display the current configuration:
+
----
cluster1::> system node autosupport show -fields smtp-encryption
----
+
. Check the overall configuration by using the `system node autosupport show` command with the `-node` parameter.
. Verify the AutoSupport operation by using the `system node autosupport check show` command.
+
If any problems are reported, use the `system node autosupport check show-details` command to view more information.

. Test that AutoSupport messages are being sent and received:
.. Use the `system node autosupport invoke` command with the `-type` parameter set to `test`.
+
----
cluster1::> system node autosupport invoke -type test -node node1
----

.. Confirm that NetApp is receiving your AutoSupport messages:
+
system node autosupport history show -node local
+
The status of the latest outgoing AutoSupport message should eventually change to `sent-successful` for all appropriate protocol destinations.

.. Optionally, confirm that AutoSupport messages are being sent to your internal support organization or to your support partner by checking the email of any address that you configured for the `-to`, `-noteto`, or `-partner-address`  parameters of the `system node autosupport modify` command.
