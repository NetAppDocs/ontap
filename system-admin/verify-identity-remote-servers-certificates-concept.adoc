ONTAP supports security certificate features to verify the identity of remote servers.

ONTAP software enables secure connections using these digital certificate features and protocols:

* Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) validates the status of digital certificate requests from ONTAP services using SSL and Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections. This feature is disabled by default.
* A default set of trusted root certificates is included with ONTAP software.
* Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) certificates enable mutual authentication of a cluster and a KMIP server.
