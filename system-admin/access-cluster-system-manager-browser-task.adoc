[.lead]
If you prefer to use a graphic interface instead of the command-line interface (CLI) for accessing and managing a cluster, you can do so by using System Manager, which is included with ONTAP as a web service, is enabled by default, and is accessible by using a browser.


[NOTE] 
====
Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, System Manager is fully integrated with BlueXP.  

With BlueXP, you can manage your hybrid multicloud infrastructure from a single control plane while retaining the familiar System Manager dashboard.

See link:../sysmgr-integration-bluexp-concept.html[System Manager integration with BlueXP].

.About this task

You can use a cluster management network interface (LIF) or node management network interface (LIF) to access System Manager. For uninterrupted access to System Manager, you should use a cluster management network interface (LIF).

.Before you begin

* You must have a cluster user account that is configured with the "`admin`" role and the "`http`" and "`console`" application types.
* You must have enabled cookies and site data in the browser.

.Steps

. Point the web browser to the IP address of the cluster management network interface:
 ** If you are using IPv4: `*https://__cluster-mgmt-LIF__*`
 ** If you are using IPv6: `*https://[_cluster-mgmt-LIF_]*`
[NOTE]
Only HTTPS is supported for browser access of System Manager.

+
If the cluster uses a self-signed digital certificate, the browser might display a warning indicating that the certificate is not trusted. You can either acknowledge the risk to continue the access or install a Certificate Authority (CA) signed digital certificate on the cluster for server authentication.

. *Optional:* If you have configured an access banner by using the CLI, then read the message that is displayed in the *Warning* dialog box, and choose the required option to proceed.
+
This option is not supported on systems on which Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication is enabled.

 ** If you do not want to continue, click *Cancel*, and close the browser.
 ** If you want to continue, click *OK* to navigate to the System Manager login page.

. Log in to System Manager by using your cluster administrator credentials.
+
NOTE: Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, when you log in to System Manager, you can specify the locale.  The locale specifies certain localization settings, such as language, currency, time and date format, and similar settings. For ONTAP 9.10.1 and earlier, the locale for System Manager is detected from the browser. To change the locale for System Manager, you have to change the locale of the browser.

. *Optional*: Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, you can specify your preference for the appearance of System Manager:
+
.. In the upper right corner of System Manager, click image:icon-user-blue-bg.png[User account icon] to manage user options.
.. Position the *System Theme* toggle switch to your preference:
