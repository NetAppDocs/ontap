= Enable ONTAP cross-cluster audits

[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.17.1, and with ONTAP 9.16.1 P4 and later 9.16.1 patch releases, you can enable cross-cluster auditing in ONTAP to log operations initiated from a peered cluster. This remote auditing is particularly valuable in environments where multiple ONTAP clusters interact, providing traceability and accountability of remote actions.

.Before you begin
* You must have `advanced` level permissions 
* The cluster must be peered with another cluster, and both clusters must be running ONTAP 9.16.1 P4 or later.
+
NOTE: In environments where some but not all nodes are upgraded to ONTAP 9.16.1 P4 or later, audit logging occurs only on nodes running the upgraded version. It's recommended to upgrade all nodes to a supported version to ensure consistent auditing behavior.

== Cross-cluster auditing options
Cross-cluster auditing can distinguish between internal or user-driven actions, GET (read) or SET (create/modify/remove) operations, and operations initiated by the admin role or non-admin relationships. 

Only user-initiated SET operations are audited on destination clusters by default. Any request that reads data, such as a GET or `show` command in the CLI, is not audited by default regardless of whether the request is cross cluster.

Tracking of GET and internal operations is off by default. These tracking options can be enabled only by using _diag_ privileges.

== Enable or disable cross-cluster auditing

.Steps
. Enable (or disable) cross-cluster auditing on the cluster by setting the `cluster-peer` parameter to `on` or `off`:
+
[source,cli]
----
security audit modify -cluster-peer {on|off}
----

. Confirm that the cluster peer setting is enabled or disabled by checking the current audit state:
+
----
security audit show
----
+
Response:
+
----
    Audit Setting State
    ------------- -----
         CLI GET: off
        HTTP GET: off
      ONTAPI GET: off
    Cluster Peer: on
