Beginning with ONTAP 9, the `command-history.log` file is replaced by `audit.log`, and the `mgwd.log` file no longer contains audit information. If you are upgrading to ONTAP 9, you should review any scripts or tools that refer to the legacy files and their contents.

After upgrade to ONTAP 9, existing `command-history.log` files are preserved. They are rotated out (deleted) as new `audit.log` files are rotated in (created).

Tools and scripts that check the `command-history.log` file might continue to work, because a soft link from `command-history.log` to `audit.log` is created at upgrade. However, tools and scripts that check the `mgwd.log` file will fail, because that file no longer contains audit information.

In addition, audit logs in ONTAP 9 and later no longer include the following entries because they are not considered useful and cause unnecessary logging activity:

* Internal commands run by ONTAP (that is, where username=root)
* Command aliases (separately from the command they point to)

Beginning with ONTAP 9, you can transmit the audit logs securely to external destinations using the TCP and TLS protocols.
