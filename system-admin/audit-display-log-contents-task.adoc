You can display the contents of the cluster's `/mroot/etc/log/mlog/audit.log` files by using the ONTAP CLI, System Manager, or a web browser.

The cluster's log file entries include the following:

Time:: The log entry timestamp.
Application:: The application used to connect to the cluster. Examples of possible values are `internal`, `console`, `ssh`, `http`, `ontapi`, `snmp`, `rsh`, `telnet`, and `service-processor`.
User:: The username of the remote user.
State:: The current state of the audit request, which could be `success`, `pending`, or `error`.
Message:: An optional field that might contain error or additional information about the status of a command.
Session ID:: The session ID on which the request is received. Each SSH _session_ is assigned a session ID, while each HTTP, ONTAPI, or SNMP _request_ is assigned a unique session ID.
Storage VM:: The SVM through which the user connected.
Scope:: Displays `svm` when the request is on a data storage VM; otherwise displays `cluster`.
Command ID:: The ID for each command received on a CLI session. This enables you to correlate a request and response. ZAPI, HTTP, and SNMP requests do not have command IDs.

You can display the cluster's log entries from the ONTAP CLI, from a web browser, and beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, from System Manager.
