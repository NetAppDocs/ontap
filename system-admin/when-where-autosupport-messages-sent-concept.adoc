AutoSupport sends messages to different recipients, depending on the type of message. Learning when and where AutoSupport sends messages can help you understand messages that you receive through email or view on the Digital Advisor web site.

Unless specified otherwise, settings in the following tables are parameters of the `system node autosupport modify` command.

== Event-triggered messages

When events occur on the system that require corrective action, AutoSupport automatically sends an event-triggered message.

[options="header"]
|===
| When the message is sent| Where the message is sent
a|
AutoSupport responds to a trigger event in the EMS
a|
Addresses specified in `-to` and `-noteto`. (Only critical, service-affecting events are sent.)

Addresses specified in `-partner-address`

Technical support, if `-support` is set to `enable`

|===

== Scheduled messages

AutoSupport automatically sends several messages on a regular schedule.

[options="header"]
|===
| When the message is sent| Where the message is sent
a|
Daily (by default, sent between 12:00 a.m. and 1:00 a.m. as a log message)
a|
Addresses specified in `-partner-address`

Technical support, if `-support` is set to `enable`

a|
Daily (by default, sent between 12:00 a.m. and 1:00 a.m. as a performance message), if the `-perf` parameter is set to `true`
a|
Addresses specified in -partner-address`

Technical support, if `-support` is set to `enable`

a|
Weekly (by default, sent Sunday between 12:00 a.m. and 1:00 a.m.)
a|
Addresses specified in `-partner-address`

Technical support, if `-support` is set to `enable`

|===

== Manually triggered messages

You can manually initiate or resend an AutoSupport message.

[options="header"]
|===
| When the message is sent| Where the message is sent
a|
You manually initiate a message using the `system node autosupport invoke` command
a|
If a URI is specified using the `-uri` parameter in the `system node autosupport invoke` command, the message is sent to that URI.

If `-uri` is omitted, the message is sent to the addresses specified in `-to` and `-partner-address`. The message is also sent to technical support if `-support` is set to `enable`.
a|
You manually initiate a message using the `system node autosupport invoke-core-upload` command
a|
If a URI is specified using the `-uri` parameter in the `system node autosupport invoke-core-upload` command, the message is sent to that URI, and the core dump file is uploaded to the URI.

If `-uri` is omitted in the `system node autosupport invoke-core-upload` command, the message is sent to technical support, and the core dump file is uploaded to the technical support site.

Both scenarios require that `-support` is set to `enable` and `-transport` is set to `https` or `http`.

Due to the large size of core dump files, the message is not sent to the addresses specified in the `-to` and `-partner-addresses` parameters.

a|
You manually initiate a message using the `system node autosupport invoke-performance-archive` command
a|
If a URI is specified using the `-uri` parameter in the `system node autosupport invoke-performance-archive` command, the message is sent to that URI, and the performance archive file is uploaded to the URI.

If `-uri` is omitted in the `system node autosupport invoke-performance-archive`, the message is sent to technical support, and the performance archive file is uploaded to the technical support site.

Both scenarios require that `-support` is set to `enable` and `-transport` is set to `https` or `http`.

Due to the large size of performance archive files, the message is not sent to the addresses specified in the `-to` and `-partner-addresses` parameters.

a|
You manually resend a past message using the `system node autosupport history retransmit` command
a|
Only to the URI that you specify in the `-uri` parameter of the `system node autosupport history retransmit` command
|===

== Messages triggered by technical support

Technical support can request messages from AutoSupport using the AutoSupport OnDemand feature.

[options="header"]
|===
| When the message is sent| Where the message is sent
a|
When AutoSupport obtains delivery instructions to generate new AutoSupport messages
a|
Addresses specified in `-partner-address`

Technical support, if `-support` is set to `enable` and `-transport` is set to `https`

a|
When AutoSupport obtains delivery instructions to resend past AutoSupport messages
a|
Technical support, if `-support` is set to `enable` and `-transport` is set to `https`

a|
When AutoSupport obtains delivery instructions to generate new AutoSupport messages that upload core dump or performance archive files
a|
Technical support, if `-support` is set to `enable` and `-transport` is set to `https`. The core dump or performance archive file is uploaded to the technical support site.
