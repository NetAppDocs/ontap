You can create a message of the day (MOTD) to communicate information to authenticated CLI users. The MOTD is displayed in a console session (for cluster access only) or an SSH session (for cluster or SVM access) after a user is authenticated but before the clustershell prompt appears.

.Steps

. Use the `security login motd modify` command to create an MOTD for the cluster or SVM:
+
[options="header"]
|===
| If you want to...| Then...
a|
Specify a message that is a single line
a|
Use the `-message` "[.code]``text``" parameter to specify the text.
a|
Include newlines (also known as end of lines)
a|
Use the command without the `-message` or `-uri` parameter to launch the interactive mode for editing the MOTD.
a|
Upload content from a location to use for the MOTD
a|
Use the `-uri` parameter to specify the content's FTP or HTTP location.
|===
The maximum size for an MOTD is 2,048 bytes, including newlines.
+
`Security login motd modify` describes the escape sequences that you can use to enable the MOTD to display dynamically generated content. Learn more about `security login motd modify` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/security-login-motd-modify.html[ONTAP command reference^].
+
An MOTD created by using the `-uri` parameter is static. It is not automatically refreshed to reflect subsequent changes of the source content.
+
An MOTD created for the cluster is displayed also for all SVM logins by default, along with an SVM-level MOTD that you can create separately for a given SVM. Setting the `-is-cluster-message-enabled` parameter to `false` for an SVM prevents the cluster-level MOTD from being displayed for that SVM.

. Verify that the MOTD has been created by displaying it with the `security login motd show` command.
+
Specifying the `-message` parameter with an empty string (`""`) displays MOTDs that are not configured or have no content.

.Examples of creating MOTDs

The following example uses the noninteractive mode to create an MOTD for the "`cluster1`" cluster:

----
cluster1::> security login motd modify -message "Greetings!"
----

The following example uses the interactive mode to create an MOTD for the "`svm1`"SVM that uses escape sequences to display dynamically generated content:

----
cluster1::> security login motd modify -vserver svm1

Enter the message of the day for Vserver "svm1".
Max size: 2048. Enter a blank line to terminate input. Press Ctrl-C to abort.

Welcome to the \n SVM.  Your user ID is '\N'. Your last successful login was \L.

The following example displays the MOTDs that have been created:

----
cluster1::> security login motd show
Vserver: cluster1
Is the Cluster MOTD Displayed?: true
Message
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greetings!

Vserver: svm1
Is the Cluster MOTD Displayed?: true
Message
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the \n SVM.  Your user ID is '\N'. Your last successful login was \L.
