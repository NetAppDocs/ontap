There are several health monitors that monitor different parts of a cluster. Health monitors help you to recover from errors within ONTAP systems by detecting events, sending alerts to you, and deleting events as they clear.

| Health monitor name (identifier)| Subsystem name (identifier)| Purpose
a|
Ethernet switch

a|
Switch (Switch-Health)
a|
The ONTAP Ethernet Switch Health Monitor (CSHM) monitors the status of cluster and storage network switches while collecting logs for analysis. By default, CSHM polls each switch via SNMPv2c every 5 minutes to update resource tables with information on supportability, monitoring status, temperature sensors, CPU utilization, interface configurations and connections, cluster switch redundancy, and fan and power supply operations. Additionally, if configured, CSHM collects logs via SSH/SCP every hour, which are sent through AutoSupport for further analysis. Upon request, CSHM can also perform a more detailed tech-support log collection using SSH/SCP.

See link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-systems-switches/switch-cshm/config-overview.html[Switch health monitoring^] for further details.
