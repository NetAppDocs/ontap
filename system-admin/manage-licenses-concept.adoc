summary: "A license is a record of one or more software entitlements. Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, all licenses are delivered as a NetApp license file (NLF), which is a single file that enables multiple features.  Beginning in May 2023, all AFF systems (both A-series and C-series) and FAS systems are sold with either the ONTAP One software suite or the ONTAP Base software suite, and beginning in June 2023, all ASA systems are sold with ONTAP One for SAN."

A license is a record of one or more software entitlements. Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, all licenses are delivered as a NetApp license file (NLF), which is a single file that enables multiple features.  Beginning in May 2023, all AFF systems (both A-series and C-series) and FAS systems are sold with either the ONTAP One software suite or the ONTAP Base software suite, and beginning in June 2023, all ASA systems are sold with ONTAP One for SAN. Each software suite is delivered as a single NLF, replacing the separate NLF bundles first introduced in ONTAP 9.10.1.  

== Licenses included with ONTAP One
ONTAP One contains all available licensed functionality. It contains a combination of the contents of the former Core bundle, Data Protection bundle, Security and Compliance bundle, Hybrid Cloud bundle, and Encryption bundle, as shown in the table. Encryption is not available in restricted countries. 

|===

h| Former bundle name h| ONTAP keys included
.5+| Core bundle
| FlexClone
| SnapRestore
| NFS, SMB, S3
| FC, iSCSI
| NVME-oF

.3+| Security and Compliance bundle
| Autonomous Ransomware Protection
| MTKM
| SnapLock
.3+| Data Protection bundle
| SnapMirror (asynchronous, synchronous, Business Continuity)
| SnapCenter
| SnapMirror S3 for NetApp targets
.2+| Hybrid Cloud bundle
| SnapMirror cloud
| SnapMirror S3 for non-NetApp targets
.2+| Encryption bundle
| NetApp Volume Encryption
| Trusted Platform module
|===

== Licenses not included with ONTAP One
ONTAP One does not include any of NetApp’s cloud-delivered services, including the following:

* BlueXP tiering
* Cloud Insights
* BlueXP backup
* Data governance

== ONTAP One for existing systems

If you have existing systems that are currently under NetApp support but have not been upgraded to ONTAP One, the existing licenses on those systems are still valid and continue to work as expected. For example, if the SnapMirror license is already installed on existing systems, it is not necessary to upgrade to ONTAP One to get a new SnapMirror license. However, if you do not have a SnapMirror license installed on an existing system, the only way to get that license is to upgrade to ONTAP One for an additional fee. 


Beginning in June 2023, ONTAP systems using 28-character license keys can also link:https://kb.netapp.com/onprem/ontap/os/How_to_get_an_ONTAP_One_license_when_the_system_has_28_character_keys[upgrade to the ONTAP One or ONTAP Base compatibility bundle]. 

== Licenses included with ONTAP Base 
ONTAP Base is an optional software suite that’s an alternative to ONTAP One for ONTAP systems. It is for specific use cases where data protection technologies such as SnapMirror and SnapCenter, as well as security features like Autonomous Ransomware, are not required, such as non-production systems for dedicated test or development environments. Additional licenses cannot be added to ONTAP Base. If you want additional licenses, such as SnapMirror, you must upgrade to ONTAP One.

== Other license delivery methods

In ONTAP 8.2 through ONTAP 9.9.1, license keys are delivered as 28-character strings, and there is one key per ONTAP feature. You use the ONTAP CLI to install license keys if you are using ONTAP 8.2 through ONTAP 9.9.1.

[NOTE]
====
ONTAP 9.10.1 supports installing 28-character license keys using System Manager or the CLI. However, if an NLF license is installed for a feature, you cannot install a 28-character license key over the NetApp license file for the same feature. For information about installing NLFs or license keys using System Manager, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/install-license-task.html[Install ONTAP licenses].
