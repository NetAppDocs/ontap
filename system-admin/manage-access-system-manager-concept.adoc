You can enable or disable a web browser's access to System Manager. You can also view the System Manager log.

You can control a web browser's access to System Manager by using `vserver services web modify -name sysmgr -vserver <cluster_name> -enabled` [`true`|`false`].

System Manager logging is recorded in the `/mroot/etc/log/mlog/sysmgr.log` files of the node that hosts the cluster management LIF at the time System Manager is accessed. You can view the log files by using a browser. The System Manager log is also included in AutoSupport messages.
