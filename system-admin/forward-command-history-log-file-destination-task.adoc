You can forward the audit log to a maximum of 10 destinations. For example, you can forward the log to a Splunk or syslog server for monitoring, analysis, or backup purposes.

.About this task

To configure forwarding, you must provide the IP address of the syslog or Splunk host, its port number, a transmission protocol, and the syslog facility to use for the forwarded logs. https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5424[Learn about syslog facilities^]. 

You can select one of the following transmission values using the `-protocol` parameter:

UDP Unencrypted:: User Datagram Protocol with no security (default)
TCP Unencrypted:: Transmission Control Protocol with no security
TCP Encrypted:: Transmission Control Protocol with Transport Layer Security (TLS) +
A *Verify server* option is available when the TCP Encrypted protocol is selected.

The default port is 514 for UDP and 6514 for TCP, but you can designate any port that meets the needs of your network.

You can select one of the following message formats using the `-message-format` command:

legacy-netapp:: A variation of the RFC-3164 Syslog format (format: <PRIVAL>TIMESTAMP HOSTNAME: MSG)
rfc-5424:: Syslog format as per RFC-5424 (format: <PRIVAL>VERSION TIMESTAMP HOSTNAME: MSG)

You can forward audit logs from the ONTAP CLI, and beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, from System Manager.

* If the `cluster log-forwarding create` command cannot ping the destination host to verify connectivity, the command fails with an error. Although not recommended, using the `-force` parameter with the command bypasses the connectivity verification.
* When you set the `-verify-server` parameter to `true`, the identity of the log forwarding destination is verified by validating its certificate. You can set the value to `true` only when you select the `tcp-encrypted` value in the `-protocol` field.

. Verify that the destination records are correct by using the `cluster log-forwarding show` command.
