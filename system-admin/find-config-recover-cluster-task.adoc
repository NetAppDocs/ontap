[.lead]
You use the configuration from either a node in the cluster or a cluster configuration backup file to recover a cluster.

.Steps

. Choose a type of configuration to recover the cluster.
 ** A node in the cluster
+
If the cluster consists of more than one node, and one of the nodes has a cluster configuration from when the cluster was in the desired configuration, then you can recover the cluster using the configuration stored on that node.
+
In most cases, the node containing the replication ring with the most recent transaction ID is the best node to use for restoring the cluster configuration. The `cluster ring show` command at the advanced privilege level enables you to view a list of the replicated rings available on each node in the cluster.

 ** A cluster configuration backup file
+
If you cannot identify a node with the correct cluster configuration, or if the cluster consists of a single node, then you can use a cluster configuration backup file to recover the cluster.
+
If you are recovering the cluster from a configuration backup file, any configuration changes made since the backup was taken will be lost. You must resolve any discrepancies between the configuration backup file and the present configuration after recovery. See Knowledge Base article link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Storage_Software/ONTAP_OS/ONTAP_Configuration_Backup_Resolution_Guide[ONTAP Configuration Backup Resolution Guide] for troubleshooting guidance.
. If you chose to use a cluster configuration backup file, then make the file available to the node you plan to use to recover the cluster.

Use the `system configuration backup download` command at the advanced privilege level to download it to the recovering node.

 .. Use the `system configuration backup show` command at the advanced privilege level to find a cluster configuration backup file that was created when the cluster was in the desired configuration.
 .. If the cluster configuration backup file is not located on the node you plan to use to recover the cluster, then use the `system configuration backup copy` command to copy it to the recovering node.
