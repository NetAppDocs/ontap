[.lead]
You restore the node configuration using the configuration backup file that you identified and made available to the recovering node.

.About this task

You should only perform this task to recover from a disaster that resulted in the loss of the node's local configuration files.  

.Steps

. Change to the advanced privilege level:
+
`set -privilege advanced`

. If the node is healthy, then at the advanced privilege level of a different node, use the `cluster modify` command with the `-node` and `-eligibility` parameters to mark it ineligible and isolate it from the cluster.
+
If the node is not healthy, then you should skip this step.
+
This example modifies node2 to be ineligible to participate in the cluster so that its configuration can be restored:
+
----
cluster1::*> cluster modify -node node2 -eligibility false
----
+
Learn more about `cluster modify` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/cluster-modify.html[ONTAP command reference^].

. Use the `system configuration recovery node restore` command at the advanced privilege level to restore the node's configuration from a configuration backup file.
+
If the node lost its identity, including its name, then you should use the `-nodename-in-backup` parameter to specify the node name in the configuration backup file.
+
This example restores the node's configuration using one of the configuration backup files stored on the node:
+
----
cluster1::*> system configuration recovery node restore -backup cluster1.8hour.2011-02-22.18_15_00.7z

Warning: This command overwrites local configuration files with
         files contained in the specified backup file. Use this
         command only to recover from a disaster that resulted
         in the loss of the local configuration files.
         The node will reboot after restoring the local configuration.
Do you want to continue? {y|n}: y
----
+
The configuration is restored, and the node reboots.

. If you marked the node ineligible, then use the `system configuration recovery cluster sync` command to mark the node as eligible and synchronize it with the cluster.

. If you are operating in a SAN environment, use the `system node reboot` command to reboot the node and reestablish SAN quorum.

.After you finish

If you previously re-created the cluster, and if you are restoring the node configuration by using a configuration backup file that was created prior to that cluster re-creation, then you must re-create the cluster again.
