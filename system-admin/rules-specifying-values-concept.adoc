Most commands include one or more required or optional parameters. Many parameters require you to specify a value for them. A few rules exist for specifying values in the CLI.

* A value can be a number, a Boolean specifier, a selection from an enumerated list of predefined values, or a text string.
+
Some parameters can accept a comma-separated list of two or more values. Comma-separated lists of values do not need to be in quotation marks (" "). Whenever you specify text, a space, or a query character (when not meant as a query or text starting with a less-than or greater-than symbol), you must enclose the entity in quotation marks.

* The CLI interprets a question mark (`?`) as the command to display help information for a particular command.
* Some text that you enter in the CLI, such as command names, parameters, and certain values, is not case-sensitive.
+
For example, when you enter parameter values for the `vserver cifs` commands, capitalization is ignored. However, most parameter values, such as the names of nodes, storage virtual machines (SVMs), aggregates, volumes, and logical interfaces, are case-sensitive.

* If you want to clear the value of a parameter that takes a string or a list, you specify an empty set of quotation marks ("") or a dash ("-").
* The hash sign (`#`), also known as the pound sign, indicates a comment for a command-line input; if used, it should appear after the last parameter in a command line.
+
The CLI ignores the text between `#` and the end of the line.

In the following example, an SVM is created with a text comment. The SVM is then modified to delete the comment:

----
cluster1::> vserver create -vserver vs0 -subtype default -rootvolume root_vs0
-aggregate aggr1 -rootvolume-security-style unix -language C.UTF-8 -is-repository false -ipspace ipspaceA -comment "My SVM"
cluster1::> vserver modify -vserver vs0 -comment ""
----

In the following example, a command-line comment that uses the `#` sign indicates what the command does.

----
cluster1::> security login create -vserver vs0 -user-or-group-name new-admin
-application ssh -authmethod password #This command creates a new user account
----
