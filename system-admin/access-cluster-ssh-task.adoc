[.lead]
You can issue SSH requests to an ONTAP cluster to perform administrative tasks. SSH is enabled by default.

.Before you begin

* You must have a user account that is configured to use `ssh` as an access method.
+
The `-application` parameter of the `security login` commands specifies the access method for a user account. Learn more about the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/security-login-create.html#description[`security login`^] command in the ONTAP command reference.

* If you use an Active Directory (AD) domain user account to access the cluster, an authentication tunnel for the cluster must have been set up through a CIFS-enabled storage VM, and your AD domain user account must also have been added to the cluster with `ssh` as an access method and `domain` as the authentication method.

.About this task

* You must use an OpenSSH 5.7 or later client.
* Only the SSH v2 protocol is supported; SSH v1 is not supported.
* ONTAP supports a maximum of 64 concurrent SSH sessions per node.
+
If the cluster management LIF resides on the node, it shares this limit with the node management LIF.
+
If the rate of incoming connections is higher than 10 per second, the service is temporarily disabled for 60 seconds.

* ONTAP supports only the AES and 3DES encryption algorithms (also known as _ciphers_) for SSH.
+
AES is supported with 128, 192, and 256 bits in key length. 3DES is 56 bits in key length as in the original DES, but it is repeated three times.

* When FIPS mode is on, SSH clients should negotiate with Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) public key algorithms for the connection to be successful.
* If you want to access the ONTAP CLI from a Windows host, you can use a third-party utility such as PuTTY.
* If you use a Windows AD user name to log in to ONTAP, you should use the same uppercase or lowercase letters that were used when the AD user name and domain name were created in ONTAP.
+
AD user names and domain names are not case-sensitive. However, ONTAP user names are case-sensitive. Case mismatch between the user name created in ONTAP and the user name created in AD results in a login failure.

.SSH Authentication options
// Make a JIRA ticket to address this better in future

* Beginning with ONTAP 9.3, you can link:../authentication/setup-ssh-multifactor-authentication-task.html[enable SSH multifactor authentication^] for local administrator accounts.
+
When SSH multifactor authentication is enabled, users are authenticated by using a public key and a password.

* Beginning with ONTAP 9.4, you can link:../authentication/grant-access-nis-ldap-user-accounts-task.html[enable SSH multifactor authentication^] for LDAP and NIS remote users.

* Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, you can optionally add certificate validation to the SSH authentication process to enhance login security. To do this, link:../authentication/manage-ssh-public-keys-and-certificates.html[associate an X.509 certificate with the public key^] that an account uses. If you log in using SSH with both an SSH public key and an X.509 certificate, ONTAP checks the validity of the X.509 certificate before authenticating with the SSH public key. SSH login is refused if that certificate is expired or revoked, and the SSH public key is automatically disabled.

* Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, ONTAP administrators can link:../authentication/configure-cisco-duo-mfa-task.html[add Cisco Duo two-factor authentication to the SSH authentication process^] to enhance login security. Upon first login after you enable Cisco Duo authentication, users will need to enroll a device to serve as an authenticator for SSH sessions. 

* Beginning with ONTAP 9.15.1, administrators can link:../authentication/dynamic-authorization-overview.html[Configure dynamic authorization^] to provide additional adaptive authentication to SSH users based on the user's trust score.

.Steps

. From a host with access to the ONTAP cluster's network, enter the `ssh` command in one of the following formats:
 ** `*ssh _username@hostname_or_IP_ [_command_]*`
 ** `*ssh -l _username hostname_or_IP_ [_command_]*`

If you are using an AD domain user account, you must specify `_username_` in the format of `_domainname\\AD_accountname_` (with double backslashes after the domain name) or `"_domainname\AD_accountname_"` (enclosed in double quotation marks and with a single backslash after the domain name).

`_hostname_or_IP_` is the host name or the IP address of the cluster management LIF or a node management LIF. Using the cluster management LIF is recommended. You can use an IPv4 or IPv6 address.

`_command_` is not required for SSH-interactive sessions.

.Examples of SSH requests

The following examples show how the user account named "`joe`" can issue an SSH request to access a cluster whose cluster management LIF is 10.72.137.28:

----
$ ssh joe@10.72.137.28
Password:
cluster1::> cluster show
Node                  Health  Eligibility
--------------------- ------- ------------
node1                 true    true
node2                 true    true
2 entries were displayed.
----

----
$ ssh -l joe 10.72.137.28 cluster show
Password:
Node                  Health  Eligibility
--------------------- ------- ------------
node1                 true    true
node2                 true    true
2 entries were displayed.
----

The following examples show how the user account named "`john`" from the domain named "`DOMAIN1`" can issue an SSH request to access a cluster whose cluster management LIF is 10.72.137.28:

----
$ ssh DOMAIN1\\john@10.72.137.28
Password:
cluster1::> cluster show
Node                  Health  Eligibility
--------------------- ------- ------------
node1                 true    true
node2                 true    true
2 entries were displayed.
----

----
$ ssh -l "DOMAIN1\john" 10.72.137.28 cluster show
Password:
Node                  Health  Eligibility
--------------------- ------- ------------
node1                 true    true
node2                 true    true
2 entries were displayed.
----

The following example shows how the user account named "`joe`" can issue an SSH MFA request to access a cluster whose cluster management LIF is 10.72.137.32:

----
$ ssh joe@10.72.137.32
Authenticated with partial success.
Password:
cluster1::> cluster show
Node                  Health  Eligibility
--------------------- ------- ------------
node1                 true    true
node2                 true    true
2 entries were displayed.
