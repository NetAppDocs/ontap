ONTAP provides commands for managing the SP, including the SP network configuration, SP firmware image, SSH access to the SP, and general SP administration.

== Commands for managing the SP network configuration

[options="header"]
|===
| If you want to...| Run this ONTAP command...
a|
Enable the SP automatic network configuration for the SP to use the IPv4 or IPv6 address family of the specified subnet
a|
`system service-processor network auto-configuration enable`
a|
Disable the SP automatic network configuration for the IPv4 or IPv6 address family of the subnet specified for the SP
a|
`system service-processor network auto-configuration disable`
a|
Display the SP automatic network configuration
a|
`system service-processor network auto-configuration show`
a|
Manually configure the SP network for a node, including the following:

* The IP address family (IPv4 or IPv6)
* Whether the network interface of the specified IP address family should be enabled
* If you are using IPv4, whether to use the network configuration from the DHCP server or the network address that you specify
* The public IP address for the SP
* The netmask for the SP (if using IPv4)
* The network prefix-length of the subnet mask for the SP (if using IPv6)
* The gateway IP address for the SP

a|
`system service-processor network modify`
a|
Display the SP network configuration, including the following:

* The configured address family (IPv4 or IPv6) and whether it is enabled
* The remote management device type
* The current SP status and link status
* Network configuration, such as IP address, MAC address, netmask, prefix-length of subnet mask, router-assigned IP address, link local IP address, and gateway IP address
* The time the SP was last updated
* The name of the subnet used for SP automatic configuration
* Whether the IPv6 router-assigned IP address is enabled
* SP network setup status
* Reason for the SP network setup failure

a|
`system service-processor network show`

Displaying complete SP network details requires the `-instance` parameter.

a|
Modify the SP API service configuration, including the following:

* Changing the port used by the SP API service
* Enabling or disabling the SP API service

a|
`system service-processor api-service modify`

(advanced privilege level)

a|
Display the SP API service configuration

a|
`system service-processor api-service show`

(advanced privilege level)

a|
Renew the SSL and SSH certificates used by the SP API service for internal communication

a|

* For ONTAP 9.5 or later: `system service-processor api-service renew-internal-certificates`
* For ONTAP 9.4 or earlier: `system service-processor api-service renew-certificates`
+
(advanced privilege level)

== Commands for managing the SP firmware image

[options="header"]
|===
| If you want to...| Run this ONTAP command...
a|
Display the details of the currently installed SP firmware image, including the following:

* The remote management device type
* The image (primary or backup) that the SP is booted from, its status, and firmware version
* Whether the firmware automatic update is enabled and the last update status

a|
`system service-processor image show`

The `-is-current` parameter indicates the image (primary or backup) that the SP is currently booted from, not if the installed firmware version is most current.

a|
Enable or disable the SP automatic firmware update
a|
`system service-processor image modify`

By default, the SP firmware is automatically updated with the update of ONTAP or when a new version of the SP firmware is manually downloaded. Disabling the automatic update is not recommended because doing so can result in suboptimal or nonqualified combinations between the ONTAP image and the SP firmware image.

a|
Manually download an SP firmware image on a node
a|
`system node image get`
[NOTE]
====
Before you run the `system node image` commands, you must set the privilege level to advanced (`set -privilege advanced`), entering *y* when prompted to continue.
====

The SP firmware image is packaged with ONTAP. You do not need to download the SP firmware manually, unless you want to use an SP firmware version that is different from the one packaged with ONTAP.

a|
Display the status for the latest SP firmware update triggered from ONTAP, including the following information:

* The start and end time for the latest SP firmware update
* Whether an update is in progress and the percentage that is complete

a|
`system service-processor image update-progress show`
|===

== Commands for managing SSH access to the SP

[options="header"]
|===
| If you want to...| Run this ONTAP command...
a|
Grant SP access to only the specified IP addresses
a|
`system service-processor ssh add-allowed-addresses`
a|
Block the specified IP addresses from accessing the SP
a|
`system service-processor ssh remove-allowed-addresses`
a|
Display the IP addresses that can access the SP
a|
`system service-processor ssh show`
|===

== Commands for general SP administration

[options="header"]
|===
| If you want to...| Run this ONTAP command...
a|
Display general SP information, including the following:

* The remote management device type
* The current SP status
* Whether the SP network is configured
* Network information, such as the public IP address and the MAC address
* The SP firmware version and Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) version
* Whether the SP firmware automatic update is enabled

a|
`system service-processor show` Displaying complete SP information requires the `-instance` parameter.

a|
Reboot the SP on a node
a|
`system service-processor reboot-sp`
a|
Generate and send an AutoSupport message that includes the SP log files collected from a specified node
a|
`system node autosupport invoke-splog`
a|
Display the allocation map of the collected SP log files in the cluster, including the sequence numbers for the SP log files that reside in each collecting node
a|
`system service-processor log show-allocations`
