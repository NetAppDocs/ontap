Jobs are placed into a job queue and run in the background when resources are available. If a job is consuming too many cluster resources, you can stop it or pause it until there is less demand on the cluster. You can also monitor and restart jobs.

When you enter a command that invokes a job, typically, the command informs you that the job has been queued and then returns to the CLI command prompt. However, some commands instead report job progress and do not return to the CLI command prompt until the job has been completed. In these cases, you can press Ctrl-C to move the job to the background.
