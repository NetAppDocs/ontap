[.lead]
You can issue RSH requests to the cluster to perform administrative tasks. RSH is not a secure protocol and is disabled by default.

Telnet and RSH are not secure protocols; you should consider using SSH to access the cluster. SSH provides a secure remote shell and interactive network session. For more information, refer to link:./access-cluster-ssh-task.html[Access the cluster using SSH].

.Before you begin

The following conditions must be met before you can use RSH to access the cluster:

* You must have a cluster local user account that is configured to use RSH as an access method.
+
The `-application` parameter of the `security login` commands specifies the access method for a user account. Learn more about `security login` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/search.html?q=security+login[ONTAP command reference^].

.About this task

* ONTAP supports a maximum of 50 concurrent RSH sessions per node.
+
If the cluster management LIF resides on the node, it shares this limit with the node management LIF.
+
If the rate of incoming connections is higher than 10 per second, the service is temporarily disabled for 60 seconds.

* RSH commands require advanced privileges.

.Steps

. Confirm that the RSH security protocol is enabled:
+
`security protocol show`

.. If the RSH security protocol is enabled, continue to the next step.
.. If the RSH security protocol is not enabled, use the following command to enable it:
+
`security protocol modify -application rsh -enabled true` 

. Confirm that the `management-rsh-server` service exists on the management LIFs:
+
`network interface show -services management-rsh-server`

.. If the `management-rsh-server` service exists, continue to the next step.
.. If the `management-rsh-server` service does not exist, use the following command to add it:
+ 
`network interface service-policy add-service -vserver cluster1 -policy default-management -service management-rsh-server`

.ONTAP 9.9 or earlier
--

.Before you begin

The following conditions must be met before you can use RSH to access the cluster:

* RSH must already be enabled in the management firewall policy that is used by the cluster or node management LIFs so that RSH requests can go through the firewall.
+
By default, RSH is disabled. The system services firewall policy show command with the `-service rsh` parameter displays whether RSH has been enabled in a firewall policy. Learn more about `system services firewall policy` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/search.html?q=system+services+firewall+policy[ONTAP command reference^].

* If you use IPv6 connections, IPv6 must already be configured and enabled on the cluster, and firewall policies must already be configured with IPv6 addresses.
+
The `network options ipv6 show` command displays whether IPv6 is enabled. The `system services firewall policy show` command displays firewall policies.

.Steps

. From an administration host, enter the following command:
+
`rsh hostname_or_IP -l username:passwordcommand`
+
`hostname_or_IP` is the host name or the IP address of the cluster management LIF or a node management LIF. Using the cluster management LIF is recommended. You can use an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
+
`command` is the command you want to execute over RSH.

.Example of an RSH request

The following example shows how the user named "`joe`", who has been set up with RSH access, can issue an RSH request to run the `cluster show` command:

----

admin_host$ rsh 10.72.137.28 -l joe:password cluster show

Node                  Health  Eligibility
--------------------- ------- ------------
node1                 true    true
node2                 true    true
2 entries were displayed.
