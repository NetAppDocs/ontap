AutoSupport messages have severity types that help you understand the purpose of each message--for example, to draw immediate attention to an emergency problem, or only to provide information.

Messages have one of the following severities:

* *Alert*: Alert messages indicate that a next-higher level event might occur if you do not take some action.
+
You must take an action against alert messages within 24 hours.

* *Emergency*: Emergency messages are displayed when a disruption has occurred.
+
You must take an action against emergency messages immediately.

* *Error*: Error conditions indicate what might happen if you ignore.
* *Notice*: Normal but significant condition.
* *Info*: Informational message provides details about the issue, which you can ignore.
* *Debug*: Debug-level messages provide instructions you should perform.

If your internal support organization receives AutoSupport messages through email, the severity appears in the subject line of the email message.
