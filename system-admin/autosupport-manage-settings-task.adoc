== Enable or disable AutoSupport

AutoSupport delivers proven business benefits to NetApp customers, including proactive identification of possible configuration issues and accelerated support case resolution. AutoSupport is enabled by default in new systems. If required, you can use System Manager to disable the ability of AutoSupport to monitor the health of your storage system and send you notification messages. You can enable AutoSupport again after it has been disabled.

.About this task

Before you disable AutoSupport, you should be aware that you are turning off the NetApp call-home system and you'll lose the following benefits:

* *Health Monitoring*: AutoSupport monitors the health of your storage system and sends notifications to technical support and your internal support organization.

* *Automation*: AutoSupport automates the reporting of support cases. Most support cases are opened automatically before customers realize there's a problem.

* *Faster resolution*: Systems sending AutoSupport data have their support cases resolved in half of the time compared to cases for systems that not sending AutoSupport data.

* *Faster upgrades*: AutoSupport powers customer self-service workflows, such as version upgrades, add-ons, renewals, and firmware update automation in System Manager.

* *More functions*: Certain functions in other tools work only when AutoSupport is enabled, for example, some workflows in BlueXP.
