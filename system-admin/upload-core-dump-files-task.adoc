[.lead]
When a core dump file is saved, an event message is generated. If the AutoSupport service is enabled and configured to send messages to NetApp support, an AutoSupport message is transmitted, and an automated email acknowledgement is sent to you.

.What you'll need

* You must have set up AutoSupport with the following settings:
 ** AutoSupport is enabled on the node.
 ** AutoSupport is configured to send messages to technical support.
 ** AutoSupport is configured to use the HTTP or HTTPS transport protocol.
+
The SMTP transport protocol is not supported when sending messages that include large files, such as core dump files.

.About this task

You can also upload the core dump file through the AutoSupport service over HTTPS by using the `system node autosupport invoke-core-upload` command, if requested by NetApp support.

.Steps

. View the core dump files for a node by using the `system node coredump show` command.
+
In the following example, core dump files are displayed for the local node:
+
----
cluster1::> system node coredump show -node local
Node:Type Core Name Saved Panic Time
--------- ------------------------------------------- ----- -----------------
node:kernel
core.4073000068.2013-09-11.15_05_01.nz true 9/11/2013 15:05:01
----

. Generate an AutoSupport message and upload a core dump file by using the `system node autosupport invoke-core-upload` command.
+
In the following example, an AutoSupport message is generated and sent to the default location, which is technical support, and the core dump file is uploaded to the default location, which is the NetApp support site:
+
----
cluster1::> system node autosupport invoke-core-upload -core-filename
core.4073000068.2013-09-11.15_05_01.nz -node local
----
+
In the following example, an AutoSupport message is generated and sent to the location specified in the URI, and the core dump file is uploaded to the URI:
+
----
cluster1::> system node autosupport invoke-core-upload -uri https//files.company.com -core-filename
core.4073000068.2013-09-11.15_05_01.nz -node local
