[.lead]
A web service is an application that users can access by using HTTP or HTTPS. The cluster administrator can set up the web protocol engine, configure SSL, enable a web service, and enable users of a role to access a web service.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.6, the following web services are supported:

* Service Processor Infrastructure (`spi`)
+
This service makes a node's log, core dump, and MIB files available for HTTP or HTTPS access through the cluster management LIF or a node management LIF. The default setting is `enabled`.
+
Upon a request to access a node's log files or core dump files, the `spi` web service automatically creates a mount point from a node to another node's root volume where the files reside. You do not need to manually create the mount point. `

* ONTAP APIs (`ontapi`)
+
This service enables you to run ONTAP APIs to execute administrative functions with a remote program. The default setting is `enabled`.
+
This service might be required for some external management tools. For example, if you use System Manager, you should leave this service enabled.

* Data ONTAP Discovery (`disco`)
+
This service enables off-box management applications to discover the cluster in the network. The default setting is `enabled`.

* Support Diagnostics (`supdiag`)
+
This service controls access to a privileged environment on the system to assist problem analysis and resolution. The default setting is `disabled`. You should enable this service only when directed by technical support.

* System Manager (`sysmgr`)
+
This service controls the availability of System Manager, which is included with ONTAP. The default setting is `enabled`. This service is supported only on the cluster.

* Firmware Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) Update (`FW_BMC`)
+
This service enables you to download BMC firmware files. The default setting is `enabled`.

* ONTAP Documentation (`docs`)
+
This service provides access to the ONTAP documentation. The default setting is `enabled`.

* ONTAP RESTful APIs (`docs_api`)
+
This service provides access to the ONTAP RESTful API documentation. The default setting is `enabled`.

* File Upload and Download (`fud`)
+
This service offers file upload and download. The default setting is `enabled`.

* ONTAP Messaging (`ontapmsg`)
+
This service supports a publish and subscribe interface allowing you to subscribe to events. The default setting is `enabled`.

* ONTAP Portal (`portal`)
+
This service implements the gateway into a virtual server. The default setting is `enabled`.

* ONTAP Restful Interface (`rest`)
+
This service supports a RESTful interface that is used to remotely manage all elements of the cluster infrastructure. The default setting is `enabled`.

* Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) Service Provider Support (`saml`)
+
This service provides resources to support the SAML service provider. The default setting is `enabled`.

* SAML Service Provider (`saml-sp`)
+
This service offers services such as SP metadata and the assertion consumer service to the service provider. The default setting is `enabled`.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.7, the following additional services are supported:

* Configuration Backup Files (`backups`)
+
This service enables you to download configuration backup files. The default setting is `enabled`.

* ONTAP Security (`security`)
+
This service supports CSRF token management for enhanced authentication. The default setting is `enabled`.
