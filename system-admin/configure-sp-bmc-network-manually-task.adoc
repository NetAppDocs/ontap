[.lead]
If you do not have automatic network configuration set up for the SP, you must manually configure a node's SP network for the SP to be accessible by using an IP address.

.Before you begin

If you want to use IPv6 connections for the SP, IPv6 must already be configured and enabled for ONTAP. The `network options ipv6` commands manage IPv6 settings for ONTAP. Learn more about `network options ipv6` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/search.html?q=network+options+ipv6[ONTAP command reference^].

[NOTE]
====
This task applies to both the SP and the BMC.
====

You can configure the SP to use IPv4, IPv6, or both. The SP IPv4 configuration supports static and DHCP addressing, and the SP IPv6 configuration supports static addressing only.

If the SP automatic network configuration has been set up, you do not need to manually configure the SP network for individual nodes, and the `system service-processor network modify` command allows you to only enable or disable the SP network interface.

.Steps

. Configure the SP network for a node by using the `system service-processor network modify` command.
 ** The `-address-family` parameter specifies whether the IPv4 or IPv6 configuration of the SP is to be modified.
 ** The `-enable` parameter enables the network interface of the specified IP address family.
 ** The `-dhcp` parameter specifies whether to use the network configuration from the DHCP server or the network address that you provide.
+
You can enable DHCP (by setting `-dhcp` to `v4`) only if you are using IPv4. You cannot enable DHCP for IPv6 configurations.

 ** The `-ip-address` parameter specifies the public IP address for the SP.
+
A warning message appears when you attempt to manually configure the SP network with addresses that are allocated to a subnet. Ignoring the warning and proceeding with the manual address assignment might result in a duplicate address assignment.

 ** The `-netmask` parameter specifies the netmask for the SP (if using IPv4.)
 ** The `-prefix-length` parameter specifies the network prefix-length of the subnet mask for the SP (if using IPv6.)
 ** The `-gateway` parameter specifies the gateway IP address for the SP.
. Configure the SP network for the remaining nodes in the cluster by repeating the step 1.
. Display the SP network configuration and verify the SP setup status by using the `system service-processor network show` command with the `–instance` or `–field setup-status` parameters.
+
The SP setup status for a node can be one of the following:

 ** `not-setup` -- Not configured
 ** `succeeded` -- Configuration succeeded
 ** `in-progress` -- Configuration in progress
 ** `failed` -- Configuration failed

.Example of configuring the SP network

The following example configures the SP of a node to use IPv4, enables the SP, and displays the SP network configuration to verify the settings:
