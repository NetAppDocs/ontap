You can use the security certificate `generate-csr` command to generate a certificate signing request (CSR). After processing your request, the certificate authority (CA) sends you the signed digital certificate.

.Before you begin

You must be a cluster administrator or SVM administrator to perform this task.

.Steps

. Generate a CSR:
+
`*security certificate generate-csr -common-name _FQDN_or_common_name_ -size 512|1024|1536|2048 -country _country_ -state _state_ -locality _locality_ -organization _organization_ -unit _unit_ -email-addr _email_of_contact_ -hash-function SHA1|SHA256|MD5*`
+
For complete command syntax, see the man pages.
+
The following command creates a CSR with a 2,048-bit private key generated by the SHA256 hashing function for use by the Software group in the IT department of a company whose custom common name is server1.companyname.com, located in Sunnyvale, California, USA. The email address of the SVM contact administrator is \web@example.com. The system displays the CSR and the private key in the output.

server1.companyname.com -size 2048 -country US -state California -
locality Sunnyvale -organization IT -unit Software -email-addr
web@example.com -hash-function SHA256
Certificate Signing Request :
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
<certificate_value>
-----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
Private Key :
24 | Administrator Authentication and RBAC 
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
<key_value>
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
Note: Please keep a copy of your certificate request and private key
for future reference.

. Copy the certificate request from the CSR output, and then send it in electronic form (such as email) to a trusted third-party CA for signing.
+
After processing your request, the CA sends you the signed digital certificate. You should keep a copy of the private key and the CA-signed digital certificate.
