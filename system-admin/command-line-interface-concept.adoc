The ONTAP command-line interface (CLI) provides a command-based view of the management interface. You enter commands at the storage system prompt, and command results are displayed in text.

The CLI command prompt is represented as `cluster_name::>`.

If you set the privilege level (that is, the `-privilege` parameter of the `set` command) to `advanced`, the prompt includes an asterisk (*), for example:

`cluster_name::*>`
