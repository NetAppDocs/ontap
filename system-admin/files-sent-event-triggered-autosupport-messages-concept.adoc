Event-triggered AutoSupport messages only contain basic and troubleshooting information from subsystems that are associated with the event that caused AutoSupport to generate the message. The specific data helps NetApp support and support partners troubleshoot the problem.

AutoSupport uses the following criteria to control content in event-triggered AutoSupport messages:

* Which subsystems are included
+
Data is grouped into subsystems, including common subsystems, such as Log Files, and specific subsystems, such as RAID. Each event triggers a message that contains only the data from specific subsystems.

* The detail level of each included subsystem
+
Data for each included subsystem is provided at a basic or troubleshooting level.

You can view all possible events and determine which subsystems are included in messages about each event using the `system node autosupport trigger show` command with the `-instance` parameter.

In addition to the subsystems that are included by default for each event, you can add additional subsystems at either a basic or a troubleshooting level using the `system node autosupport trigger modify` command.
