[.lead]
You can display node names, whether the nodes are healthy, and whether they are eligible to participate in the cluster. At the advanced privilege level, you can also display whether a node holds epsilon.

.Steps

. To display information about the nodes in a cluster, use the `cluster show` command.
+
If you want the output to show whether a node holds epsilon, run the command at the advanced privilege level.

.Examples of displaying the nodes in a cluster

The following example displays information about all nodes in a four-node cluster:

----

cluster1::> cluster show
Node                  Health  Eligibility
--------------------- ------- ------------
node1                 true    true
node2                 true    true
node3                 true    true
node4                 true    true
----

The following example displays detailed information about the node named "`node1`" at the advanced privilege level:

----

cluster1::> set -privilege advanced
Warning: These advanced commands are potentially dangerous; use them only when directed to do so by support personnel.

cluster1::*> cluster show -node node1

       Node: node1
  Node UUID: a67f9f34-9d8f-11da-b484-000423b6f094
    Epsilon: false
Eligibility: true
     Health: true
