AutoSupport collects information, organized by subsystem, and enforces a size and time budget on content for each subsystem. As storage systems grow, AutoSupport budgets provide control over the AutoSupport payload, which in turn provides scalable delivery of AutoSupport data.

AutoSupport stops collecting information and truncates the AutoSupport content if the subsystem content exceeds its size or time budget. If the content cannot be truncated easily (for example, binary files), AutoSupport omits the content.

You should modify the default size and time budgets only if asked to do so by NetApp Support. You can also review the default size and time budgets of the subsystems by using the `autosupport manifest show` command.
