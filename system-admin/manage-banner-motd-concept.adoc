ONTAP enables you to configure a login banner or a message of the day (MOTD) to communicate administrative information to System Manager and CLI users of the cluster or storage virtual machine (SVM).

A banner is displayed in a console session (for cluster access only) or an SSH session (for cluster or SVM access) before a user is prompted for authentication such as a password. For example, you can use the banner to display a warning message such as the following to someone who attempts to log in to the system:

----
$ ssh admin@cluster1-01

This system is for authorized users only. Your IP Address has been logged.

Password:

----

An MOTD is displayed in a console session (for cluster access only) or an SSH session (for cluster or SVM access) after a user is authenticated but before the clustershell prompt appears. For example, you can use the MOTD to display a welcome or informational message such as the following that only authenticated users will see:

----
$ ssh admin@cluster1-01

Password:

Greetings. This system is running ONTAP 9.0.
Your user name is 'admin'. Your last login was Wed Apr 08 16:46:53 2015 from 10.72.137.28.

You can create or modify the content of the banner or MOTD by using the `security login banner modify` or `security login motd modify` command, respectively, in the following ways:

* You can use the CLI interactively or noninteractively to specify the text to use for the banner or MOTD.
+
The interactive mode, launched when the command is used without the `-message` or `-uri` parameter, enables you to use newlines (also known as end of lines) in the message.
+
The noninteractive mode, which uses the `-message` parameter to specify the message string, does not support newlines.

* You can upload content from an FTP or HTTP location to use for the banner or MOTD.
* You can configure the MOTD to display dynamic content.
+
Examples of what you can configure the MOTD to display dynamically include the following:

 ** Cluster name, node name, or SVM name
 ** Cluster date and time
 ** Name of the user logging in
 ** Last login for the user on any node in the cluster
 ** Login device name or IP address
 ** Operating system name
 ** Software release version
 ** Effective cluster version string
The `security login motd modify` man page describes the escape sequences that you can use to enable the MOTD to display dynamically generated content.

+
The banner does not support dynamic content.

You can manage the banner and MOTD at the cluster or SVM level:

* The following facts apply to the banner:
 ** The banner configured for the cluster is also used for all SVMs that do not have a banner message defined.
 ** An SVM-level banner can be configured for each SVM.
+
If a cluster-level banner has been configured, it is overridden by the SVM-level banner for the given SVM.
* The following facts apply to the MOTD:
 ** By default, the MOTD configured for the cluster is also enabled for all SVMs.
 ** Additionally, an SVM-level MOTD can be configured for each SVM.
+
In this case, users logging in to the SVM will see two MOTDs, one defined at the cluster level and the other at the SVM level.

 ** The cluster-level MOTD can be enabled or disabled on a per-SVM basis by the cluster administrator.
+
If the cluster administrator disables the cluster-level MOTD for an SVM, a user logging in to the SVM does not see the cluster-level MOTD.
