summary: "Mutually authenticating the cluster and an external key manager such as a Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) server enables the key manager to communicate with the cluster by using KMIP over SSL. You do so when an application or certain functionality (for example, the Storage Encryption functionality) requires secure keys to provide secure data access."

Mutually authenticating the cluster and an external key manager such as a Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) server enables the key manager to communicate with the cluster by using KMIP over SSL. You do so when an application or certain functionality (for example, the Storage Encryption functionality) requires secure keys to provide secure data access.
