If cluster-wide quorum exists, but one or more nodes are out of sync with the cluster, then you must synchronize the node to restore the replicated database (RDB) on the node and bring it into quorum.

.Step

. From a healthy node, use the `system configuration recovery cluster sync` command at the advanced privilege level to synchronize the node that is out of sync with the cluster configuration.
+
This example synchronizes a node (_node2_) with the rest of the cluster:
+
----
cluster1::*> system configuration recovery cluster sync -node node2

Warning: This command will synchronize node "node2" with the cluster
         configuration, potentially overwriting critical cluster
         configuration files on the node. This feature should only be
         used to recover from a disaster. Do not perform any other
         recovery operations while this operation is in progress. This
         command will cause all the cluster applications on node
         "node2" to restart, interrupting administrative CLI and Web
         interface on that node.
Do you want to continue? {y|n}: y
All cluster applications on node "node2" will be restarted. Verify that the cluster applications go online.

.Result

The RDB is replicated to the node, and the node becomes eligible to participate in the cluster.
