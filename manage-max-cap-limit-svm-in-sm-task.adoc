Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, you can use System Manager to enable a maximum capacity limit for a storage VM and set a threshold to trigger alerts when the used storage reaches a certain percentage of the maximum capacity.

== Enable a maximum capacity limit for a storage VM

Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, you can specify the maximum capacity that can be allocated for all volumes in a storage VM.  You can enable the maximum capacity when you add a storage VM or when you edit an existing storage VM.

.Steps

. Select *Storage* > *Storage VMs*.

. Perform one of the following:

. Enter or modify the settings for the storage VM, and select the check box labeled "Enable maximum capacity limit".

. Specify the maximum capacity size.

. Specify the percentage of the maximum capacity you want to use as a threshold to trigger alerts.

. Click *Save*.
