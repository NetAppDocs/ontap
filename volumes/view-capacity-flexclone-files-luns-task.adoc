You should determine whether a node has capacity to receive requests to create and delete FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs. This can be done by viewing the split load for the node. If the maximum split load is reached, no new requests are accepted until the split load falls below the maximum.

 can view whether a node has capacity to receive new requests to create and delete FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs by viewing the split load for the node. If the maximum split load is reached, no new requests are accepted until the split load falls below the maximum.

.About this task

When the node reaches its maximum split load, an `EBUSY` error message is issued in response to create and delete requests. When the split load for the node falls below the maximum, the node accepts requests to create and delete FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs again.

A node can accept new requests when the `Allowable Split Load` field displays capacity, and the create request fits in the available capacity.

.Steps

. View how much capacity a node has to create and delete FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs by using the `volume file clone split load show` command.
+
In the following example, the split load is displayed for all of the nodes in cluster1. All nodes in the cluster have capacity to create and delete FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs as indicated by the Allowable Split Load field:
