[.lead]
To convert a directory to a qtree using a Windows client, you rename the directory, create a qtree on the storage system, and move the contents of the directory to the qtree.

.About this task

You must use Windows Explorer for this procedure. You cannot use the Windows command-line interface or the DOS prompt environment.

.Steps

. Open Windows Explorer.
. Click the folder representation of the directory you want to change.
+
[NOTE]
====
The directory must reside at the root of its containing volume.
====

. From the *File* menu, select *Rename* to give this directory a different name.
. On the storage system, use the `volume qtree create` command to create a new qtree with the original name of the directory.
. In Windows Explorer, open the renamed directory folder and select the files inside it.
. Drag these files into the folder representation of the new qtree.
+
[NOTE]
====
The more subfolders contained in the folder that you are moving, the longer the move operation takes.
====

. From the *File* menu, select *Delete* to delete the renamed, now-empty directory folder.
