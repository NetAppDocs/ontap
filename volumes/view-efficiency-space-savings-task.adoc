[.lead]
You can view the amount of space savings achieved through deduplication and data compression on a volume. You might do this to assess the effectiveness of your administrative processes or as part of capacity planning.

.About this task

You need to use the command `volume show` to display the space savings on a volume. Note that the space savings in snapshots is not included when calculating the space savings achieved on a volume. Using deduplication does not affect volume quotas. Quotas are reported at the logical level and remain unchanged.

.Steps

. Use the `volume show` command to view space savings achieved on a volume using deduplication and data compression.

.Example

The following command enables you to view the space savings achieved by using deduplication and data compression on volume VolA: `volume show -vserver vs1 -volume VolA`

----
cluster1::> volume show -vserver vs1 -volume VolA

                                 Vserver Name: vs1
                                  Volume Name: VolA

            Space Saved by Storage Efficiency: 115812B
       Percentage Saved by Storage Efficiency: 97%
                 Space Saved by Deduplication: 13728B
            Percentage Saved by Deduplication: 81%
                Space Shared by Deduplication: 1028B
                   Space Saved by Compression: 102084B
        Percentage Space Saved by Compression: 97%
