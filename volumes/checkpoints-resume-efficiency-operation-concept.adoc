Checkpoints are used internally to log the execution process of an efficiency operation. When an efficiency operation is stopped for any reason (such as system halt, system disruption, reboot, or because the last efficiency operation failed or stopped) and checkpoint data exists, the efficiency operation can resume from the latest checkpoint file.

A checkpoint is created:

* in each stage or substage of the operation
* when you run the `sis stop` command
* when the duration expires
