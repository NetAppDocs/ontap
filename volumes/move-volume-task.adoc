[.lead]
You can move a FlexVol volume to a different aggregate, node, or both within the same storage virtual machine (SVM) to balance storage capacity after determining that there is a storage capacity imbalance.

.About this task

By default, if the cutover operation fails to complete within 30 seconds, it will retry. You can adjust the default behavior by using the `-cutover-window` and `-cutover-action` parameters, both of which require advanced privilege level access. Learn more about `volume move start` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/volume-move-start.html[ONTAP command reference^].

.Steps

. If you are moving a data protection mirror and you have not initialized the mirror relationship, initialize the mirror relationship by using the `snapmirror initialize` command.
+
Data protection mirror relationships must be initialized before you can move one of the volumes.

. Determine an aggregate to which you can move the volume by using the `volume move target-aggr show` command.
+
The aggregate that you select must have enough space for the volume; that is, the available size is bigger than the volume that you are moving.
+
The following example shows that the vs2 volume can be moved to any of the listed aggregates:
+
----
cluster1::> volume move target-aggr show -vserver vs2 -volume user_max
Aggregate Name   Available Size   Storage Type
--------------   --------------   ------------
aggr2            467.9GB          hdd
node12a_aggr3    10.34GB          hdd
node12a_aggr2    10.36GB          hdd
node12a_aggr1    10.36GB          hdd
node12a_aggr4    10.36GB          hdd
5 entries were displayed.
----

. Verify that the volume can be moved to the intended aggregate by using the `volume move start -perform-validation-only` command to run a validation check.
. Move the volume by using the `volume move start` command.
+
The following command moves the user_max volume on the vs2 SVM to the node12a_aggr3 aggregate. The move runs as a background process.
+
----
cluster1::> volume move start -vserver vs2 -volume user_max
-destination-aggregate node12a_aggr3
----

. Determine the status of the volume move operation by using the `volume move show` command.
+
The following example shows the state of a volume move that completed the replication phase and is in the cutover phase:
+
----

cluster1::> volume move show
Vserver   Volume     State    Move Phase  Percent-Complete Time-To-Complete
--------- ---------- -------- ----------  ---------------- ----------------
vs2       user_max   healthy  cutover     -                -
----
+
The volume move is complete when it no longer appears in the `volume move show` command output.
