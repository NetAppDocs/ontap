[.lead]
Default volume delete behavior aids the recovery of accidentally deleted FlexVol volumes.

A `volume delete` request against a volume that has type `RW` or `DP` (as seen in `volume show` command output) causes that volume to be moved to a partially deleted state. By default, it is retained in a recovery queue for at least 12 hours before being fully deleted.

[NOTE]
 Deleting the SVM that contains the deleted volume clears the Volume Recovery Queue (VRQ). Only delete an SVM when you are certain that there is no need to recover volumes owned by the SVM.  Volumes in the volume recovery queue cannot exist when the owning SVM is deleted.
