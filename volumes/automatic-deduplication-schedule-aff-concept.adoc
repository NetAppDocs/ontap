Beginning with ONTAP 9.3, you can configure volume-level background deduplication to run automatically using a predefined `auto` AFF policy. No manual configuration of the schedules is required. The `auto` policy performs continuous deduplication in the background.

The `auto` policy is set for all newly created volumes and for all upgraded volumes that have not been manually configured for background deduplication. You can link:assign-volume-efficiency-policy-task.html[change the policy] to `default` or any other policy to disable the feature.

If a volume moves from a non-AFF system to an AFF system, the `auto` policy is enabled on the destination node by default. If a volume moves from an AFF node to a non-AFF node, the `auto` policy on the destination node is replaced by the `inline-only` policy by default.

On AFF, the system monitors all the volumes having the `auto` policy and deprioritizes the volume that has less savings or has frequent overwrites. The deprioritized volumes no longer participate in automatic background deduplication. Change logging on deprioritized volumes is disabled and metadata on the volume is truncated.

Users can promote the deprioritized volume to re-participate in an automatic background deduplication using the `volume efficiency promote` command available at the advanced privilege level.
