[.lead]
Storage efficiency features are enabled by default on all newly created volumes on AFF systems. All inline storage efficiency features are enabled by default on all existing and newly created volumes on all AFF systems.

Storage efficiency features include inline deduplication, inline cross-volume deduplication and inline compression, and are enabled by default on AFF systems as shown in the table.

[NOTE]
====
Data compaction behavior on AFF volumes is enabled by default.

The following exceptions apply to one or more inline storage efficiency features:

* Only read-write volumes can support default inline storage efficiency enablement.
* Volumes with compression savings are omitted from enabling inline compression.
* Volumes that have postprocess deduplication turned on are omitted from enabling inline compression.
* On volumes where volume efficiency is turned off, the system overrides the existing volume efficiency policy settings and sets it to enable the inline-only policy.
