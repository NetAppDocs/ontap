[.lead]
After you make extensive changes to existing quota definitions, you must re-initialize the quotas on all affected volumes. An example of this type of change is adding or deleting quotas for targets that have no enforced quotas.

.About this task

You have a storage virtual machine (SVM) with enforced quotas and you want to make changes that require a full reinitialization of quotas.

.Steps

. Use the `vserver show` command with the `-instance` parameter to determine the name of the policy that is currently assigned to the SVM.
. Modify quota rules by performing any of the following actions:
+
[cols="2*",options="header"]
|===
| If you want to...| Then...
a|
Create new quota rules
a|
Use the `volume quota policy rule create` command
a|
Modify the settings of existing quota rules
a|
Use the `volume quota policy rule modify` command
a|
Delete existing quota rules
a|
Use the `volume quota policy rule delete` command
|===

. Use the `volume quota policy rule show` command to check that the quota rules are configured correctly.
. Re-initialize quotas on each volume where you changed quotas by turning quotas off and then turning quotas on for those volumes.
 .. Use the `volume quota off` command on each affected volume to deactivate quotas on that volume.
 .. Use the `volume quota on` command on each affected volume to activate quotas on that volume.
+
[NOTE]
====
You must ensure that you wait for about five minutes before reactivating the quotas on each affected volume, as attempting to activate them almost immediately after running the `volume quota off` command might result in errors.

Alternatively, you can run the commands to re-initialize the quotas for a volume from the node that contains the particular volume.
====
+
You can monitor the initialization process in either of the following ways:

  *** When you use the `volume quota on` command, you can add the `-foreground` parameter to run the quota on job in the foreground. (By default, the job runs in the background.)
+
When the job runs in the background, you can monitor its progress by using the `job show` command.

  *** You can use the `volume quota show` command to monitor the status of the quota initialization.
. Use the `volume quota show -instance` command to check for initialization errors, such as quota rules that failed to initialize.
. Use the `volume quota report` command to display a quota report so that you can ensure the enforced quotas match your expectations.
