You can rehost a volume defined as part of a SnapMirror relationship. There are several issues you need to consider before rehosting the relationship.

.About this task

* Rehosting is a disruptive operation.
* If the rehosting operation fails, you might need to reconfigure the volume policies and the associated rules on the source volume.
* After the rehost operation, the following volume policies, policy rules, and configurations are lost from the source volume and must be manually reconfigured on the rehosted volume:
 ** Volume and qtree export policies
 ** Antivirus policies
 ** Volume efficiency policy
 ** Quality of service (QoS) policies
 ** Snapshot policies
 ** Quota rules
 ** ns-switch and name services configuration export policy and rules
 ** User and group IDs

.Before you begin

* The volume must be online.
* Volume management operations, such as volume moves or LUN moves, must not be running.
* Data access to the volume that is being rehosted must be stopped.
* The ns-switch and name services configuration of the target SVM must be configured to support data access of the rehosting volume.
* The user ID and group ID of the volume must be either available in the target SVM or changed on the hosting volume.


.Steps

. Record the SnapMirror relationship type:
+
`snapmirror show`
+
This is a precautionary step to avoid losing information about the SnapMirror relationship type in case the volume rehost fails.

. From the destination cluster, delete the SnapMirror relationship:
+
`snapmirror delete`
+
You must not break the SnapMirror relationship; otherwise, the data protection capability of the destination volume is lost and the relationship cannot be reestablished after the rehosting operation.

. From the source cluster, remove the SnapMirror relationship information:
+
`snapmirror release -relationship-info-only true`
+
Setting the `-relationship-info-only` parameter to `true` removes the source relationship information without deleting the snapshots.

. If the volume is mounted, unmount it:
+
`volume unmount -vserver <source_svm> -volume <vol_name>`

. Switch to the advanced privilege level:
+
`set -privilege advanced`
. Rehost the volume on the destination SVM:
+
`volume rehost -vserver <source_svm> -volume <vol_name> -destination-vserver <destination_svm>`
. If the SVM peering relation is not present, create the SVM peer relationship between the source SVM and destination SVM:
+
`vserver peer create`
. Create the SnapMirror relationship between the source volume and destination volume:
+
`snapmirror create`
+
You must run the `snapmirror create` command from the SVM that is hosting the DP volume. The rehosted volume can be the source or destination of the SnapMirror relationship.

. Resynchronize the SnapMirror relationship.
