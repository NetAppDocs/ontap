You can disable data compression on a volume by using the `volume efficiency modify` command. Learn more about `volume efficiency modify` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/volume-efficiency-modify.html[ONTAP command reference^].

.About this task

If you want to disable postprocess compression, you must first disable inline compression on the volume.

.Steps

. Stop any volume efficiency operation that is currently active on the volume:
+
`volume efficiency stop`
. Disable data compression:
+
`volume efficiency modify`
+
Existing compressed data will remain compressed on the volume. Only new writes coming into the volume are not compressed.

.Examples

The following command disables inline compression on volume VolA:

`volume efficiency modify -vserver vs1 -volume VolA -inline-compression false`

The following command disables both postprocess compression and inline compression on volume VolA:

`volume efficiency modify -vserver vs1 -volume VolA -compression false -inline-compression false`
