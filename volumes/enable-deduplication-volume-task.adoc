[.lead]
You can enable deduplication on a FlexVol volume to achieve storage efficiency. You can enable postprocess deduplication on all volumes and inline deduplication on volumes that reside on AFF or Flash Pool aggregates.

If you want to enable inline deduplication on other types of volumes, see the Knowledge Base article link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Storage_Software/ONTAP_OS/How_to_enable_volume_inline_deduplication_on_Non-AFF_(All_Flash_FAS)_aggregates[How to enable volume inline deduplication on Non-AFF (All Flash FAS) aggregates^].

.Before you begin
For a FlexVol volume, you must have verified that enough free space exists for deduplication metadata in volumes and aggregates. The deduplication metadata requires a minimum amount of free space in the aggregate. This amount is equal to 3% of the total amount of physical data for all deduplicated FlexVol volumes or data constituents within the aggregate. Each FlexVol volume or data constituent should have 4% of the total amount of physical data's worth of free space, for a total of 7%.

[NOTE]
====
Beginning with ONTAP 9.2, inline deduplication is enabled by default on AFF systems.

.Choices

* Use the `volume efficiency on` command to enable postprocess deduplication.
+
The following command enables postprocess deduplication on volume VolA:
+
`volume efficiency on -vserver vs1 -volume VolA`

* Use the `volume efficiency on` command followed by the `volume efficiency modify` command with the `-inline-deduplication` option set to `true` to enable both postprocess deduplication and inline deduplication.
+
The following commands enable both postprocess deduplication and inline deduplication on volume VolA:
+
`volume efficiency on -vserver vs1 -volume VolA`
+
`volume efficiency modify -vserver vs1 -volume VolA -inline-dedupe true`

* Use the `volume efficiency on` command followed by the `volume efficiency modify` command with the `-inline-deduplication` option set to `true` and the `-policy` option set to `inline-only` to enable only inline deduplication.
+
The following commands enable only inline deduplication on volume VolA:
+
`volume efficiency on -vserver vs1 -volume VolA`
+
`volume efficiency modify -vserver vs1 -volume VolA -policy inline-only -inline-dedupe true`

.After you finish

Verify that the setting has changed by viewing the volume efficiency settings:
`volume efficiency show -instance`
