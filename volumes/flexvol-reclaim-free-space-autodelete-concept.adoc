You can enable the autodelete setting of a FlexVol volume to automatically delete FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs. By enabling autodelete, you can reclaim a target amount of free space in the volume when a volume is nearly full.

You can configure a volume to automatically start deleting FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs when the free space in the volume decreases below a particular threshold value, and automatically stop deleting clones when a target amount of free space in the volume is reclaimed. Although, you cannot specify the threshold value that starts the automatic deletion of clones, you can specify whether a clone is eligible for deletion, and you can specify the target amount of free space for a volume.

A volume automatically deletes FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs when the free space in the volume decreases below a particular threshold and when _both_ of the following requirements are met:

* The autodelete capability is enabled for the volume that contains the FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs.
+
You can enable the autodelete capability for a FlexVol volume by using the `volume snapshot autodelete modify` command. You must set the `-trigger` parameter to `volume` or `snap_reserve` for a volume to automatically delete FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs.

* The autodelete capability is enabled for the FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs.
+
You can enable autodelete for a FlexClone file or FlexClone LUN by using the `file clone create` command with the `-autodelete` parameter. As a result, you can preserve certain FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs by disabling autodelete for the clones and ensuring that other volume settings do not override the clone setting.
