[.lead]
Although both commands show information about quotas, the `volume quota policy rule show` quickly displays configured quota rules while the `volume quota report` command, which consumes more time and resources, displays enforced quotas and resource usage.

The `volume quota policy rule show` command is useful for the following purposes:

* Check the configuration of quota rules before activating them
+
This command displays all configured quota rules regardless of whether the quotas have been initialized or resized.

* Quickly view quota rules without affecting system resources
+
Because it does not display disk and file usage, this command is not as resource intensive as a quota report.

* Display the quota rules in a quota policy that is not assigned to the SVM.

The `volume quota report` command is useful for the following purposes:

* View enforced quotas, including derived quotas
* View the disk space and number of files used by every quota in effect, including targets affected by derived quotas
+
(For default quotas, the usage appears as "0" because the usage is tracked against the resulting derived quota.)

* Determine which quota limits affect when a write to a file will be allowed
+
Add the `-path` parameter to the `volume quota report` command.

[NOTE]
====
The quota report is resource-intensive operation. If you run it on many FlexVol volumes in the cluster, it might take a long time to complete. A more efficient way would be to view the quota report for a particular volume in an SVM.
