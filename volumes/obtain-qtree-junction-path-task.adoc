You can mount an individual qtree by obtaining the junction path or namespace path of the qtree. The qtree path displayed by the CLI command `qtree show -instance` is of the format `/vol/<volume_name>/<qtree_name>`. However, this path does not refer to the junction path or namespace path of the qtree.

.About this task

You need to know the junction path of the volume to obtain the junction path or namespace path of the qtree.

.Steps

. Use the `vserver volume junction-path` command to obtain the junction path of a volume.
+
The following example displays the junction path of the volume named vol1 located on the storage virtual machine (SVM) named vs0:
+
----
cluster1::> volume show -volume vol1 -vserver vs0 -fields junction-path

------- ------ -------------

vs0 vol1 /vol1
----
+
From the above output, the volume's junction path is `/vol1`. Since qtrees are always rooted at the volume, the junction path or namespace path of the qtree will be `/vol1/qtree1`.
