[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, the volume-level storage efficiency modes _default_ and _efficient_ are supported for AFF systems only. These modes provide a choice between file compression (default), which is the default mode when creating new AFF volumes, or temperature-sensitive storage efficiency (efficient), which enables temperature-sensitive storage efficiency (TSSE). 

NOTE: TSSE is supported only on thinly provisioned volumes. link:enable-temperature-sensitive-efficiency-concept.html[Learn more about TSSE].


.Steps

You can perform this task using ONTAP System Manager or the ONTAP CLI.

.System Manager
--

Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can use System Manager to enable higher storage efficiency using the temperature-sensitive storage efficiency feature. Performance-based storage efficiency is enabled by default.

. Click *Storage > Volumes*.
. Locate the volume on which you want to enable or disable storage efficiency, and click image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon].

. Click *Edit > Volumes*, and scroll to *Storage Efficiency*.
. Select *Enable Higher Storage Efficiency*.

.CLI
--

You can use the `volume efficiency modify` command to change the storage efficiency mode for an AFF volume from `default` to `efficient`, or you can set an efficiency mode when volume efficiency is not already set.

. Change the volume efficiency mode:
