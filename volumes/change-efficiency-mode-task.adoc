Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, the volume-level storage efficiency modes _default_ and _efficient_ are supported for AFF systems only. These modes provide a choice between file compression (default), which is the default mode when creating new AFF volumes, or temperature-sensitive storage efficiency (efficient), which enables temperature-sensitive storage efficiency. You can use the `volume efficiency modify` command to change the storage efficiency mode for an AFF volume from `default` to `efficient`, or you can set an efficiency mode when volume efficiency is not already set.
