summary: "If you are moving a volume from a platform that _does not_ support dedicated offload processor storage efficiency to a platform that _does_ support dedicated offload storage efficiency, you should increase the size of the volume's active file system before moving the volume to prevent the volume from running out of space."

= Increase your ONTAP volume size before migrating from 8k adaptive compression

[.lead]
Platforms that support 8k adaptive compression save space at the volume level. AFF C-Series platforms and platforms that support 32k compression save space at the aggregate level.  When migrating a volume from 8k adaptive compression to an AFF C-Series platform or to a platform with 32k compression, increase the volume size by the expected 8k compression savings. This prevents the volume from running out of free space during the volume move.

The following systems support 32k compression:

See the link:https://hwu.netapp.com/[Hardware Universe^] for a full list of AFF C-series platforms.

.About this task
Perform these steps if you are migrating your data using a volume move operation. If you are migrating your data using a SnapMirror operation, you do not need to manually increase the volume size. SnapMirror destination volumes use volume autosize by default, and therefore are not expected to run out of space due to compression savings being realized at the aggregate layer instead of the volume layer.

.Before you begin

If logical space reporting and enforcement is not enabled on your volume, you can optionally enable it by setting the `-is-space-reporting-logical` and `-is-space-enforcement-logical` parameters to *true*. Enabling these settings before the volume move can help you assess if your volume is large enough to accommodate the compression savings loss at the volume layer when you covert from 8k compression. You should enable these settings on the volume.  If you enable these settings at the SVM level, they are applied to newly created volumes only.

.Steps

. Verify the volume's current size:
+
[source, cli]
----
volume show -vserver <vserver_name> -volume <volume_name> -fields size
----

. Check the volume's expected compression space savings:
+
[source,cli]
----
volume show -vserver -volume -fields compression-space-saved
----

. Increase the volume's active filesystem size by the amount shown for `compression-space-saved`.
+
[source, cli]
----
volume size -vserver <vserver_name> -volume <volume_name> -new-size +<size>
----
+
.Example
+
If `compression-space-saved` shows that 20GB of space savings is expected, you should increase the volume's size by at least 20GB. 
+
----
volume size -vserver svm1 -volume volx -size +20GB
----

. Verify that the size of the volume is increase:
+
[source, cli]
----
volume show -vserver <vserver_name> -volume <volume_name> -fields size
----

.Result
Your volume's active file system size is increased by the amount of expected compression space savings and you are ready to move the volume.
