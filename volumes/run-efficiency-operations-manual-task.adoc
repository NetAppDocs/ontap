You can run efficiency operations manually on a volume by using the `volume efficiency start` command.

.What you'll need

Depending on the efficiency operation you want to run manually, you must have enabled deduplication or both data compression and deduplication on a volume.

.About this task

If deduplication and data compression are enabled on a volume, data compression is run initially followed by deduplication.

Deduplication is a background process that consumes system resources while it is running. If the data does not change often in a volume, it is best to run deduplication less frequently. Multiple concurrent deduplication operations running on a storage system lead to a higher consumption of system resources.

You can run a maximum of eight concurrent deduplication or data compression operations per node. If any more efficiency operations are scheduled, the operations are queued.

.Step

. Use the `volume efficiency start` command to start the efficiency operation on a volume.

.Example

The following command allows you to manually start only deduplication or data compression followed by deduplication on the volume VolA:

`volume efficiency start -vserver vs1 -volume VolA`
