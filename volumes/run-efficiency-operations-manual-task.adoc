You can run efficiency operations manually on a volume by using the `volume efficiency start` command.

.What you'll need

Depending on the efficiency operation you want to run manually, you must have enabled deduplication or both data compression and deduplication on a volume.

.About this task

When temperature-sensitive storage efficiency is enabled on a volume, deduplication is run initially followed by data compression.

Deduplication is a background process that consumes system resources while it is running. If the data does not change often in a volume, it is best to run deduplication less frequently. Multiple concurrent deduplication operations running on a storage system lead to a higher consumption of system resources.

You can run a maximum of eight concurrent deduplication or data compression operations per node. If any more efficiency operations are scheduled, the operations are queued.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, if temperature-sensitive storage efficiency is enabled on a volume, you can run volume efficiency on existing data to take advantage of sequential packing to further improve storage efficiency. 

== Run efficiency manually

.Step

. Start the efficiency operation on a volume: `volume efficiency start` 
+
.Example
+
The following command allows you to manually start only deduplication or deduplication followed by logical compression and container compression on the volume VolA
+
----
volume efficiency start -vserver vs1 -volume VolA
----

== Repack existing data

To take advantage of sequential data packing introduced in ONTAP 9.13.1 on volumes with temperature-sensitive storage efficiency enabled, you can repack existing data. You must be in advanced privilege mode to use this command.

.Step

. Set the privilege level: `set -privilege advanced`

. Repack existing data: `volume efficiency inactive-data-compression start -vserver _vserver_name_ -volume _volume_name_ -scan-mode extended_recompression`

+
.Example
+
----
volume efficiency inactive-data-compression start -vserver vs1 -volume vol1 -scan-mode extended_recompression
