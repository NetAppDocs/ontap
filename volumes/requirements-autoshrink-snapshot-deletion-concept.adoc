[.lead]
The autoshrink functionality can be used with automatic snapshot deletion as long as certain configuration requirements are met.

If you want to enable both the autoshrink functionality and automatic snapshot deletion, your configuration must meet the following requirements:

* ONTAP must be configured to attempt to increase volume size before trying to delete Snapshot copies(the `-space-mgmt-try-first` option must be set to `volume_grow`).
* The trigger for automatic snapshot deletion must be volume fullness(the `trigger` parameter must be set to `volume`).
