To convert a directory to a qtree in UNIX, you rename the directory, create a qtree on the storage system, and move the directory's contents to the qtree.

.Steps

. Open a UNIX client window.
. Use the `mv` command to rename the directory.
+
----
client: mv /n/user1/vol1/dir1 /n/user1/vol1/olddir
----

. From the storage system, use the `volume qtree create` command to create a qtree with the original name.
+
----
system1: volume qtree create /n/user1/vol1/dir1
----
+
Learn more about `volume qtree create` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/volume-qtree-create.html[ONTAP command reference^].

. From the client, use the `mv` command to move the contents of the old directory into the qtree.
+
[NOTE]
====
The more subdirectories contained in a directory that you are moving, the longer the move operation will take.
====
+
----
client: mv /n/user1/vol1/olddir/* /n/user1/vol1/dir1
----

. Use the `rmdir` command to delete the old, now-empty directory.
+
----
client: rmdir /n/user1/vol1/olddir
----

.After you finish

Depending on how your UNIX client implements the `mv` command, file ownership and permissions might not be preserved. If this occurs, update file owners and permissions to their previous values.
