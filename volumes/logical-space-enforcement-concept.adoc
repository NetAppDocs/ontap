Logical space enforcement ensures that users are notified when a volume is full or nearly full. When you enable logical space enforcement in ONTAP 9.5 and later, ONTAP counts the logical-used blocks in a volume to determine the amount of space that is still available in that volume. If there is no space available in a volume, the system returns an ENOSPC (out-of-space) error message.

Logical space enforcement returns three types of alerts to inform you about the available space in a volume:

* `Monitor.vol.full.inc.sav`: This alert is triggered when 98% of the logical space in the volume has been used.
* `Monitor.vol.nearFull.inc.sav`: This alert is triggered when 95% of the logical space in the volume has been used.
* `Vol.log.overalloc.inc.sav`: This alert is triggered when the logical space used in the volume is greater than the total size of the volume.
+
This alert tells you that adding to the size of the volume might not create available space since that space will already be consumed by overallocated logical blocks.

[NOTE]
====
Total (logical space) should be equal to provisioned space excluding snapshot reserve of the volume with logical space enforcement.
