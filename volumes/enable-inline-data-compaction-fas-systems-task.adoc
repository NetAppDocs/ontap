[.lead]
You can enable inline data compaction on FAS systems with Flash Pool (hybrid) aggregates or HDD aggregates at the volume level by using the `volume efficiency` cluster shell command. Data compaction is disabled by default for volumes created on FAS systems.

.About this task

To enable inline data compaction on a volume, its `-space-guarantee` option must be set to `none`. Enabling data compaction on a volume on an HDD aggregate uses additional CPU resources.

.Steps

. Change to the advanced privilege level:
+
[source, cli]
----
set -privilege advanced
----

. Check the data compaction state of the volumes and aggregates for the desired node:
+
[source, cli]
----
volume efficiency show -volume <volume_name>
----

. Enable data compaction on volume:
+
[source, cli]
----
volume efficiency modify -volume <volume_name> -data-compaction true
----
+
[NOTE] 
====
If data compaction is set to `false` for either an aggregate or a volume, then compaction fails. Enabling compaction does not compact existing data; only new writes to the system are compacted. The `volume efficiency start` command contains more information about how to compact existing data. 
For more information, see the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli[ONTAP command reference^].
