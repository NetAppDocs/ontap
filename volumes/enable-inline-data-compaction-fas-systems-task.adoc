[.lead]
You can control inline data compaction on FAS systems with Flash Pool (hybrid) aggregates or HDD aggregates at the volume or aggregate level by using the `volume efficiency` cluster shell command. Data compaction is disabled by default for FAS systems.

.About this task

If you enable data compaction at the aggregate level, data compaction is enabled on any new volume that is created with a volume space guarantee of `none` in the aggregate. Enabling data compaction on a volume on an HDD aggregate uses additional CPU resources.

.Steps

. Change to the advanced privilege level: +
`set -privilege advanced`
. Check the data compaction state of the volumes and aggregates for the desired node: +
`volume efficiency show -volume _volume_name_` +
. Enable data compaction on volume: + 
`volume efficiency modify -volume _volume_name_ -data-compaction true`
+
[NOTE] 
====
If data compaction is set to `false` for either an aggregate or a volume, then compaction fails. Enabling compaction does not compact existing data; only new writes to the system are compacted. The `volume efficiency start` command contains more information about how to compact existing data (in ONTAP 9.1 and later). +
