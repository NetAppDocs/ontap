You can manage how the efficiency operations run on a volume by running efficiency operations manually.

You can also control how the efficiency operations run based on the following conditions:

* Use checkpoints or not
* Run efficiency operations on existing data or only new data
* Stop efficiency operations if required

You can use the `volume efficiency show` command with `schedule` as value for the `-fields` option to view the schedule assigned to the volumes.
