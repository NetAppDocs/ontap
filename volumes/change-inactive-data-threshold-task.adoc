[.lead]
You can change how frequently ONTAP performs a cold data scan by modifying the coldness threshold on volumes using temperature-sensitive storage efficiency.

.Before you begin

You must be a cluster or SVM administrator and use the ONTAP CLI advanced privilege level.

.About this task

The coldness threshold can be from 1 to 60 days. The default threshold is 14 days.

.Steps

. Set the privilege level:
+
`set -privilege advanced`
. Modify inactive data compression on a volume: 
+
`volume efficiency inactive-data-compression modify -vserver <vserver_name> -volume <volume_name> -threshold-days <integer>`
