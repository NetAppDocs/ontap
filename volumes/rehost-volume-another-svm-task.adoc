A volume rehost operation enables you to reassign a NAS or SAN volume from one SVM to another SVM without requiring a SnapMirror copy. The exact rehost procedure depends upon the client access protocol used and the volume type. Volume rehost is a disruptive operation for data access and volume management.

Before you can rehost a volume from one SVM to another, the following conditions must be met:

* The volume must be online
* The volume protocol must be SAN or NAS
** For the NAS protocol volumes, the volume should not be a part of junction-path and must be unmounted
* If the volume is in a SnapMirror relationship, then the relationship must be broken and deleted prior to volume rehost
** You can resynchronize the SnapMirror relationship after the volume rehost operation
* The vserver subtype should be same for both source and destination SVMs
** Volumes can only be rehosted between SVMs of the same subtype
* The volume cannot be FlexClone or FlexClone Parent
** FlexClones must be split before rehosting the parent or clone volume
