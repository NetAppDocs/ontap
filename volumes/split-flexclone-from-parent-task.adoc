If you want a read/write FlexClone volume to have its own disk space rather than using that of its parent volume, you can split the FlexClone volume from its parent volume. Because this operation creates a copy of the data that is currently shared between the parent volume and the FlexClone volume, the operation can take some time to complete.

.About this task

Splitting a FlexClone volume from its parent volume can result in the reservation of more space on the containing aggregate. If you do not have sufficient privileges to view the space available in your aggregate, you must contact your storage administrator to verify that there is sufficient space in the aggregate for the split operation to finish.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.4, for non-guaranteed volumes on AFF systems, the split operation for FlexClone volumes shares the physical blocks and does not copy the data. Therefore, splitting of FlexClone volumes on AFF systems is faster than the FlexClone splitting operation in other FAS systems in ONTAP 9.4 and later. The improved FlexClone splitting operation on AFF systems has the following benefits:

* Storage efficiency is preserved after splitting the clone from the parent.
* Existing Snapshot copies are not deleted.
* The operation is faster.
* The FlexClone volume can be split from any point in the clone hierarchy.

.Steps

. Determine the amount of free space required to complete the split operation:
+
`volume clone show -estimate -vserver vserver_name -flexclone clone_volume_name -parent-volume parent_vol_name`
+
The following example provides information about the free space required to split a FlexClone volume clone1 from its parent volume vol1:
+
----
cluster1::> volume clone show -estimate -vserver vs1 -flexclone clone1 -parent-volume volume1
                             Split
Vserver   FlexClone       Estimate
--------- ------------- ----------
vs1       clone1           40.73MB
----

. Verify that the aggregate containing the FlexClone volume and its parent has sufficient space:
.. Determine the amount of free space in the aggregate that contains the FlexClone volume and its parent:
+
`storage aggregate show`
 .. If the containing aggregate does not have enough free space available, add storage to the aggregate:
+
`storage aggregate add-disks`
. Start the split operation:
+
`volume clone split start -vserver _vserver_name_ -flexclone _clone_volume_name_`
+
The following example shows how you can initiate the process to split the FlexClone volume clone1 from its parent volume vol1:
+
----
cluster1::> volume clone split start -vserver vs1 -flexclone clone1

Warning: Are you sure you want to split clone volume clone1 in Vserver vs1 ?

. Monitor the status of the FlexClone split operation:
+
`volume clone split show -vserver _vserver_name_ -flexclone _clone_volume_name_`
+
The following example shows the status of the FlexClone split operation on an AFF system:
+
----
cluster1::> volume clone split show -vserver vs1 -flexclone clone1
                                              Inodes                   Blocks
                                     ---------------------    ---------------------
Vserver   FlexClone    Processed Total    Scanned  Updated      % Inode   % Block
                                                                 Complete  Complete
vs1       clone1        0         0       411247   153600         0        37
----

. Verify that the split volume is no longer a FlexClone volume:
+
`volume show -volume _volume_name_ -fields _clone-volume_`
+
The value of the `clone-volume` option is `false` for a volume that is not a FlexClone volume.
+
The following example shows how you can verify whether the volume clone1 that is split from its parent is not a FlexClone volume.
+
----
cluster1::> volume show -volume clone1 -fields clone-volume
vserver volume **clone-volume**
------- ------ **------------**
vs1     clone1 **false**
