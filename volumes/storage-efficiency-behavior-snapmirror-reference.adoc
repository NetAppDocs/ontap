The behavior of storage efficiency can be affected by other storage operations that are active or started at the same time. You should be aware of the impact of these operations on storage efficiency.

There are several situations where storage efficiency on a volume can be affected by other operations including volume moves, SnapMirror relationships, FabricPool volumes, and link:enable-temperature-sensitive-efficiency-concept.html[temperature-sensitive storage efficiency (TSSE)].

=== FabricPool
The `all`` tiering policy is commonly used on data protection volumes to immediately mark data as cold and tier it as soon as possible. There is no waiting for a minimum number of days to pass before the data is made cold and tiered.

Because the `all` tiering policy tiers data as soon as possible, storage efficiencies that rely on background processes, like 32K efficient adaptive compression (TSSE), do not have enough time to be applied. Inline storage efficiencies like 8K compression are applied as normal.

The following table describes the behavior of a source volume and destination volume when you perform one of these operations.
