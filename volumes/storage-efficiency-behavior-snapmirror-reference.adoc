The behavior of storage efficiency can be affected by other storage operations that are active or started at the same time. You should be aware of the impact of these operations on storage efficiency.

There are several situations where storage efficiency on a volume can be affected by other operations. This includes when you perform a volume move or SnapMirror operation and what happens when you perform a SnapMirror break and manually enable temperature-sensitive storage efficiency (TSSE) depends on the type of efficiency on the source volume.

The following table describes the behavior of a source volume and destination volume when you perform one of these operations.
