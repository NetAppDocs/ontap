You can view the percentage of disk space saved by block sharing on a volume containing FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs. You might do this as part of capacity planning.

.Steps

. To view the space saving achieved due to FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs, enter the following command:
+
`df -s volname`
+
`volname` is the name of the FlexVol volume.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you run the `df -s` command on a deduplication-enabled FlexVol volume, you can view the space saved by both deduplication and FlexClone files and LUNs.
====

.Example

The following example shows the space saving on a FlexClone volume test1:

----
systemA> df -s test1

Filesystem         used   saved   %saved Vserver
/vol/test1/        4828    5744     54%  vs1
