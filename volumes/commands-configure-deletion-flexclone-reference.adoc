[.lead]
When clients delete FlexClone files without using the NetApp Manageability SDK, you can use the `volume file clone deletion` commands to enable faster deletion of FlexClone files from a FlexVol volume. Extensions for and minimum size of FlexClone files are used to enable faster deletion.

You can use the `volume file clone deletion` commands to specify a list of supported extensions and a minimum size requirement for FlexClone files in a volume. The faster deletion method is used only for FlexClone files that meet the requirements. For FlexClone files that do not meet the requirements, the slower deletion method is used.

When clients delete FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs from a volume by using the NetApp Manageability SDK, the extension and size requirements do not apply because the faster deletion method is always used.
