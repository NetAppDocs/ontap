[.lead]
You can efficiently use the physical storage space of the data blocks by creating a FlexClone file or FlexClone LUN of the parent file and parent LUN in a deduplication-enabled volume.

The block-sharing mechanism used by FlexClone files and LUNs is also used by deduplication. You can maximize the space savings in a FlexVol volume by enabling deduplication on the volume and then cloning the deduplication-enabled volume.

[NOTE]
====
While executing the `sis undo` command on a deduplication-enabled volume, you cannot create FlexClone files and FlexClone LUNs of the parent files and parent LUNs residing in that volume.
