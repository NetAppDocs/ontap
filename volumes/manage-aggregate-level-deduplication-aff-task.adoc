[.lead]
Aggregate-level deduplication eliminates duplicate blocks across volumes belonging to the same aggregate. You can perform aggregate-level deduplication inline on AFF systems. The feature is enabled by default for all newly created volumes and all upgraded volumes with volume inline deduplication turned on.

.About this task

The deduplication operation eliminates duplicate blocks before data is written to disk. Only volumes with the `space guarantee` set to `none` can participate in aggregate-level inline deduplication. This is the default setting on AFF systems.

[NOTE]
====
Aggregate-level inline deduplication is sometimes referred to as cross-volume inline deduplication.
