You can delete a FlexVol volume that is no longer required.

.Before you begin

No applications must be accessing the data in the volume you want to delete.

[NOTE]
====
If you accidentally delete a volume, see the Knowledge Base article link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Storage_Software/ONTAP_OS/How_to_use_the_Volume_Recovery_Queue[How to use the Volume Recovery Queue^].
====

.Steps

. If the volume has been mounted, unmount it:
+
`volume unmount -vserver vserver_name -volume volume_name`
. If the volume is part of a SnapMirror relationship, delete the relationship by using the `snapmirror delete` command.
. If the volume is online, take the volume offline:
+
`volume offline -vserver vserver_name volume_name`
. Delete the volume:
+
`volume delete -vserver vserver_name volume_name`

== Result

The volume is deleted, along with any associated quota policies and qtrees.
