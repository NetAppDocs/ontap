You can change or resize the quotas on all affected volumes, which is faster than reinitializing quotas on those volumes.

.About this task

You have a storage virtual machine (SVM, formerly known as Vserver) with enforced quotas and you want either to change the size limits of existing quotas or to add or delete quotas for targets that already have derived quotas.

.Steps

. Use the `vserver show` command with the `-instance` parameter to determine the name of the policy that is currently assigned to the SVM.
. Modify quota rules by performing any of the following actions:
 ** Use the `volume quota policy rule modify` command to modify the disk or file limits of existing quota rules.
 ** Use the `volume quota policy rule create` command to create explicit quota rules for targets (users, groups, or qtrees) that currently have derived quotas.
 ** Use the `volume quota policy rule delete` command to delete explicit quota rules for targets (users, groups, or qtrees) that also have default quotas.
. Use the `volume quota policy rule show` command to check that the quota rules are configured correctly.
. Use the `volume quota resize` command on each volume where you changed quotas, to activate the changes on each volume.
+
You can monitor the resize process in either of the following ways:

 ** When you use the `volume quota resize` command, you can add the `-foreground` parameter to run the resize job in the foreground. (By default, the job runs in the background.)
+
When the job runs in the background, you can monitor its progress by using the `job show` command.

 ** You can use the `volume quota show` command to monitor the resize status.

. Use the `volume quota show -instance` command to check for resize errors such as, quota rules that failed to get resized.
+
In particular, check for "`new definition`" errors, which occur when you resize quotas after adding an explicit quota for a target that does not already have a derived quota.

. Use the `volume quota report` command to display a quota report so that you can ensure the enforced quotas match your requirements.
