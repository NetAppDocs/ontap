You can modify the efficiency operation schedule to run deduplication or data compression when the number of new blocks written to the volume after the previous efficiency operation exceeds a specified threshold percentage. This applies whether the previous efficiency operation was performed manually or scheduled.

.About this task

If the `schedule` option is set to `auto`, the scheduled efficiency operation runs when the amount of new data exceeds the specified percentage. The default threshold value is 20 percent. This threshold value is the percentage of the total number of blocks already processed by the efficiency operation.

.Steps

. Use the `volume efficiency modify` command with the `auto@num` option to modify the threshold percentage value.
+
`num` is a two-digit number to specify the percentage.

.Example

The following command modifies the threshold percentage value to 30 percent for the volume VolA:

`volume efficiency modify -vserver vs1 -volume -VolA -schedule auto@30`
