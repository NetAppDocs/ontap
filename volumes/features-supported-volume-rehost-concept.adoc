There are several ONTAP features that do not support volume rehost. You should be aware of these features before attempting a rehost operation.

The following features are not supported with a volume rehost:

* SVM DR
* MetroCluster configurations
+
NOTE: Cloning a volume as a FlexClone volume on a different SVM is also not supported on MetroCluster configurations.

* SnapLock volumes
* NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE) volumes (in versions of ONTAP before 9.8)
+
In ONTAP releases prior to 9.8, you must unencrypt the volume before rehosting it. Volume encryption keys depend on SVM keys. If a volume is moved to another SVM and if multitenant key configuration is enabled on either the source or destination SVM, the volume and the SVM keys will not match.
+ 
Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can rehost a volume with NVE.

* FlexGroup volumes
* Clone volumes
