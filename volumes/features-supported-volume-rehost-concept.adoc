There are certain features that do not support volume rehost.

The following features do not support volume rehost:

* VDR setup
* MetroCluster configurations
* SnapLock volumes
* NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE) volumes
+
Volume encryption keys depend on SVM keys. If a volume is moved to another SVM and if multitenant key configuration is enabled on either the source or destination SVM, the volume and the SVM keys will not match.

* FlexGroup volumes
* Clone volumes
