You can SAN rehost volumes that serve data through mapped LUNs. After re-creating the initiator group (igroup) in the destination SVM, volume rehost operation can automatically remap the volume at the same SVM.

.About this task

* Rehosting is a disruptive operation.
* If the rehosting operation fails, you might need to reconfigure the volume policies and the associated rules on the source volume.
include::../_include/encypted-volume-rehost.adoc[]
* After the rehost operation, the following volume policies, policy rules, and configurations are lost from the source volume and must be manually reconfigured on the rehosted volume:
 ** Antivirus policies
 ** Volume efficiency policy
 ** Quality of service (QoS) policies
 ** Snapshot policies
 ** ns-switch and name services configuration export policy and rules
 ** User and group IDs

.Before you begin

* The volume must be online.
* Volume management operations, such as volume moves or LUN moves, must not be running.
* There must be no active I/O on the volumes or LUNs.
* You must have verified that the destination SVM does not have igroup of the same name but different initiators.
+
If the igroup has the same name, then you must have renamed the igroup in either one of the SVMs (source or destination).
* You must have enabled the `force-unmap-luns` option.
 ** The default value of the `force-unmap-luns` option is `false`.
 ** No warning or confirmation message is displayed when you set the `force-unmap-luns` option to `true`.

.Steps

. Record LUN mapping information on target volume:
+
`lun mapping show volume _volume_ vserver _source_svm_`
+
This is a precautionary step to avoid losing information about LUN mapping in case the volume rehost fails.

. Delete igroups associated with the target volume.
. Rehost the target volume to the destination SVM:
+
`volume rehost -vserver _source_svm_ -volume _volume_name_ -destination-vserver _destination_svm_`
. Map LUNs on the target volume to appropriate igroups:
 ** Volume rehost preserves LUNs on the target volume, however the LUNs remain unmapped.
 ** Use the destination SVM port set while mapping LUNs.
 ** If the `auto-remap-luns` option is set to `true`, the LUNs are mapped automatically after rehost.
