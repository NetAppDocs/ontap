[.lead]
You can run deduplication, data compression, and data compaction together or independently to achieve optimal space savings on a FlexVol volume. Deduplication eliminates duplicate data blocks. Data compression compresses the data blocks to reduce the amount of physical storage that is required. Data compaction stores more data in less space to increase storage efficiency.

[NOTE]
====
Beginning with ONTAP 9.2, all inline storage efficiency features, such as inline deduplication and inline compression, are enabled by default on AFF volumes.
