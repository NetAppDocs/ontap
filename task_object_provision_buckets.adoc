Add an S3 bucket for the new S3 object store or add additional buckets to an existing object store.

For remote client access, you must configure buckets in an S3-enabled storage VM. If you create a bucket in a storage VM that is not S3-enabled, it will only be available for local tiering.

.Steps

.	Add a new bucket on an S3-enabled storage VM.
..	Click *Storage > Buckets*, then click *Add*.
..	Enter a name, select the storage VM, and enter a size.
+
* If you click *Save* at this point, a bucket is created with these default settings:

**	No users are granted access to the bucket unless any group policies are already in effect.
+
NOTE: You should not use the S3 root user to manage ONTAP object storage and share its permissions, because it has unlimited access to the object store. Instead, create a user or group with administrative privileges that you assign.

**	A Quality of Service (performance) level that is the highest available for your system.

*	You can click *More Options* to configure user permissions and performance level when you configure the bucket, or you can modify these settings later.

**	You must have already created user and groups before using *More Options* to configure their permissions.
**	If you intend to use the S3 object store for FabricPool tiering, consider selecting *Use for tiering* (use low-cost media with optimal performance for the tiered data) rather than a performance service level.

.	On S3 client apps – another ONTAP system or an external 3rd-party app – verify access to the new bucket by entering the following:

*	The S3 server CA certificate.
*	The user’s access key and secret key.
*	The S3 server FQDN name and bucket name.
