You can delete an FC service for a storage virtual machine (SVM) if it is no longer required.

.Before you begin

The administration status must be "`down`" before you can delete a FC service for an SVM. You can set the administration status to down with either the `vserver fcp modify` command or the `vserver fcp stop` command.

.Steps

. Use the `vserver fcp stop` command to stop the I/O to the LUN.
+
`vserver fcp stop -vserver vs_1`

. Use the `vserver fcp delete` command to remove the service from the SVM.
+
`vserver fcp delete -vserver vs_1`

. Use the `vserver fcp show` to verify that you deleted the FC service from your SVM:
+
`vserver fcp show -vserver vs_1`
