In a SAN environment, a disruption in service is required during the transition of a 7-Mode volume to ONTAP. You need to shut down your hosts to complete the transition. After transition, you must update your host configurations before you can begin serving data in ONTAP

You need to schedule a maintenance window during which you can shut down your hosts and complete the transition.

LUNs that have been transitioned from Data ONTAP operating in 7-Mode to ONTAP have certain capabilities and restrictions that affect the way the LUNs can be managed.

You can do the following with transitioned LUNs:

* View the LUN using the `lun show` command
* View the inventory of LUNs transitioned from the 7-Mode volume using the `transition 7-mode show` command
* Restore a volume from a 7-Mode snapshot
+
Restoring the volume transitions all of the LUNs captured in the snapshot

* Restore a single LUN from a 7-Mode snapshot using the `snapshot restore-file` command
* Create a clone of a LUN in a 7-Mode snapshot
* Restore a range of blocks from a LUN captured in a 7-Mode snapshot
* Create a FlexClone of the volume using a 7-Mode snapshot

You cannot do the following with transitioned LUNs:

* Access snapshot-backed LUN clones captured in the volume
