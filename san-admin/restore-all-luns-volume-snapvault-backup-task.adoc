[.lead]
If one or more LUNs in a volume need to be restored from a SnapVault backup, you can restore the entire volume. Restoring the volume affects all LUNs in the volume.

.What you'll need

The SnapVault relationship must be initialized and the SnapVault secondary volume must contain an appropriate snapshot to restore.

.About this task

Restoring an entire volume returns the volume to the state it was in when the snapshot was made. If a LUN was added to the volume after the snapshot, that LUN is removed during the restore process.

After restoring the volume, the LUNs remain mapped to the igroups they were mapped to just before the restore. The LUN mapping might be different from the mapping at the time of the snapshot. Persistent reservations on the LUNs from host clusters are retained.

.Steps

. Stop I/O to all LUNs in the volume.

. Verify the secondary volume that contains the SnapVault secondary volume.

. If you are sharing LUNs across a host cluster, restore the persistent reservations on the LUNs from the affected hosts.

== Restoring a volume from a SnapVault backup

In the following example, the LUN named lun_D was added to the volume after the snapshot was created. After restoring the entire volume from the snapshot, lun_D no longer appears.

In the `lun show` command output, you can see the LUNs in the primary volume srcvolA and the read-only copies of those LUNs in the SnapVault secondary volume dstvolB. There is no copy of lun_D in the SnapVault backup.

After the volume is restored from the SnapVault secondary volume, the source volume no longer contains lun_D. You do not need to remap the LUNs in the source volume after the restore because they are still mapped.
