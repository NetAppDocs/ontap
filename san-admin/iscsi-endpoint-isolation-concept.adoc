[.lead]
Existing iSCSI security commands can accept an IP address range, or multiple IP addresses.

All iSCSI initiators must provide origination IP addresses when establishing a session or connection with a target. This new functionality prevents an initiator from logging into the cluster if the origination IP address is unsupported or unknown, providing a unique identification scheme. Any initiator originating from an unsupported or unknown IP address will have their login rejected at the iSCSI session layer, preventing the initiator from accessing any LUN or volume within the cluster.

Implement this new functionality with two new commands to help manage pre-existing entries.

== Add initiator address range

Improve iSCSI initiator security management by adding an IP address range, or multiple IP addresses with the `vserver iscsi security add-initiator-address-range` command.

`cluster1::> vserver iscsi security add-initiator-address-range`

== Remove initiator address range

Remove an IP address range, or multiple IP addresses, with the `vserver iscsi security remove-initiator-address-range` command.

`cluster1::> vserver iscsi security remove-initiator-address-range`
