[.lead]
To configure a storage virtual machine (SVM) for FC, you must create LIFs for the SVM and assign the FC protocol to those LIFs.

.Before you begin

You must have an FC license (link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/manage-licenses-concept.html#licenses-included-with-ontap-one[included with ONTAP One]) and it must be enabled. If the FC license is not enabled, the LIFs and SVMs appear to be online but the operational status is `down`. The FC service must be enabled for your LIFs and SVMs to be operational. You must use single initiator zoning for all of the FC LIFs in the SVM to host the initiators.

.About this task

NetApp supports a minimum of one FC LIF per node for each SVM serving data with the FC protocol.  You must use two LIFs per node and two fabrics, with one LIF per node attached. This provides for redundancy at the node layer and the fabric.

| To configure FC on an existing storage VM

a|
. In System Manager, click *Storage > Storage VMs* and then click *Add*.
. Enter a name for the storage VM.
. Select *FC* for the *Access Protocol*.
. Click *Enable FC*.
+ The FC ports are automatically assigned.
. Click *Save*.

. In System Manager, click *Storage > Storage VMs*.
. Click on the storage VM you want to configure.
. Click on the *Settings* tab, and then click image:icon_gear.gif[Options icon] next to the FC protocol.
. Click *Enable FC* and enter the IP address and subnet mask for the network interface.
+ The FC ports are automatically assigned.
. Click *Save*.

. Enable FC service on the SVM:
+
`vserver fcp create -vserver _vserver_name_ -status-admin up`

. Create two LIFs for the SVMs on each node serving FC:
+
* For ONTAP 9.6 and later: 
+
`network interface create -vserver _vserver_name_ -lif _lif_name_ -data-protocol fcp -service-policy default-data-fcp -home-node _node_name_ -home-port _port_name_ -address _ip_address_ -netmask _netmask_ -status-admin up`

* For ONTAP 9.5 and earlier: 
+
`network interface create -vserver _vserver_name_ -lif _lif_name_ -role data -data-protocol fcp -home-node _node_name_ -home-port _port_`

. Verify that your LIFs have been created and that their operational status is `online`:
+
`network interface show -vserver _vserver_name_ _lif_name_`
