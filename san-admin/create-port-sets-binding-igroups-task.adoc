summary: "In addition to using Selective LUN Map (SLM), you can create a portset and bind the portset to an igroup to further limit which LIFs can be used by an initiator to access a LUN. If you do not bind a portset to an igroup, then all of the initiators in the igroup can access mapped LUNs through all of the LIFs on the node owning the LUN and the owning node’s HA partner."

= Create a portset and bind to an igroup

[.lead]
In addition to using link:selective-lun-map-concept.html[Selective LUN Map (SLM)], you can create a portset and bind the portset to an igroup to further limit which LIFs can be used by an initiator to access a LUN.

If you do not bind a portset to an igroup, then all of the initiators in the igroup can access mapped LUNs through all of the LIFs on the node owning the LUN and the owning node's HA partner.

.What you'll need

You must have at least one LIF and one igroup.

Unless you are using interface groups, two LIFs are recommended for redundancy for both iSCSI and FC. Only one LIF is recommended for interface groups.

.About this task

It is advantageous to use portsets with SLM when you have more than two LIFs on a node and you want to restrict a certain initiator to a subset of LIFs. Without portsets, all targets on the node will be accessible by all of the initiators with access to the LUN through the node owning the LUN and the owning node's HA partner.

.System Manager

--
Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can use System Manager to create portsets and bind them to igroups.

If you need to create a portset and bind it to an igroup in an ONTAP release earlier than 9.10.1 you must use the ONTAP CLI procedure.

.	In System Manager, click *Network > Overview > Portsets*, and click *Add*.
.	Enter the information for the new portset and click *Add*.
.	Click *Hosts > SAN Initiator Groups*.
.	To bind the portset to a new igroup, click *Add*.
+
To bind the portset to an existing igroup, select the igroup, click image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon], and then click *Edit Initiator Group*.

. Create a port set containing the appropriate LIFs:
+
`portset create -vserver _vserver_name_ -portset _portset_name_ -protocol _protocol_ -port-name _port_name_`
+
If you are using FC, specify the `protocol` parameter as `fcp`. If you are using iSCSI, specify the `protocol` parameter as `iscsi`.

. Bind the igroup to the port set:
+
`lun igroup bind -vserver _vserver_name_ -igroup _igroup_name_ -portset _portset_name_`
. Verify that your port sets and LIFs are correct:
+
`portset show -vserver _vserver_name_`
