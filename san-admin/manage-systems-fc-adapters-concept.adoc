Commands are available to manage onboard FC adapters and FC adapter cards. These commands can be used to configure the adapter mode, display adapter information, and change the speed.

Most storage systems have onboard FC adapters that can be configured as initiators or targets. You can also use FC adapter cards configured as initiators or targets. Initiators connect to back-end disk shelves, and possibly foreign storage arrays. Targets connect only to FC switches.  Both the FC target HBA ports and the switch port speed should be set to the same value and should not be set to auto.
