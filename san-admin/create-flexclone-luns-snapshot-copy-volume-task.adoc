= Create FlexClone LUNs from a snapshot in a volume

[.lead]
You can use a snapshot in your volume to create FlexClone copies of your LUNs. FlexClone copies of LUNs are both readable and writeable.

.What you'll need

A FlexClone license must be installed. This license is included with link:../system-admin/manage-licenses-concept.html#licenses-included-with-ontap-one[ONTAP One].

.About this task

The FlexClone LUN inherits the space reservations attribute of the parent LUN. A space-reserved FlexClone LUN requires as much space as the space-reserved parent LUN. If the FlexClone LUN is not space-reserved, the volume must have enough space to accommodate changes to the clone.

.Steps

. Verify that the LUN is not mapped or being written to.
. Create a snapshot of the volume that contains the LUNs:
+
`volume snapshot create -vserver _vserver_name_ -volume _volume_name_ -snapshot _snapshot_name_`
+
You must create a snapshot (the backing snapshot) of the LUN you want to clone.

. Create the FlexClone LUN from the snapshot:
+
`file clone create -vserver _vserver_name_ -volume _volume_name_ -source-path _source_path_ -snapshot-name _snapshot_name_ -destination-path _destination_path_`
+
If you need the FlexClone LUN to be available for automatic deletion, you include `-autodelete true`. If you are creating this FlexClone LUN in a volume using semi-thick provisioning, you must enable automatic deletion for all FlexClone LUNs.

. Verify that the FlexClone LUN is correct:
+
`lun show -vserver _vserver_name_`
+
