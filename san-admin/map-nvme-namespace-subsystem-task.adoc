[.lead]
Mapping an NVMe namespace to a subsystem allows data access from your host.  You can map an NVMe namespace to a subsystem when you provision storage or you can do it after your storage has been provisioned.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can prioritize resource allocation for specific hosts. By default, when a host is added to the NVMe subsystem, it is  given regular priority. You can use the ONTAP command line interface (CLI) to manually change the default priority from regular to high.  Hosts assigned a high priority are allocated larger I/O queue counts and queue-depths. 

[NOTE]
If you want to give a high priority to a host that was added to a subsystem in ONTAP 9.13.1 or earlier, you can xref:../nvme/change-host-priority-nvme-task.html[change the host priority].

.Before you begin

Your namespace and subsystem should already be created. If you need to create a namespace and subsystem, see link:create-nvme-namespace-subsystem-task.html[Provision NVMe storage].

.Steps

. Obtain the NQN from the host.

. Add the host NQN to the subsystem:
+
[source,cli]
----
vserver nvme subsystem host add -vserver <SVM_name> -subsystem <subsystem_name> -host-nqn <Host_NQN_:subsystem._subsystem_name>
----
+
If you want to change the default priority of the host from regular to high, use the `-priority high` option. This option is available beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1.

. Map the namespace to the subsystem:
+
[source,cli]
----
vserver nvme subsystem map add -vserver <SVM_name> -subsystem <subsystem_name> -path <path>
----
+
A namespace can only be mapped to a single subsystem.

. Verify that the namespace is mapped to the subsystem:
+
[source,cli]
----
vserver nvme namespace show -vserver <SVM_name> -instance
----
+
The subsystem should be listed as the `Attached subsystem`.
