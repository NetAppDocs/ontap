You can move a LUN across volumes within a storage virtual machine (SVM), but you cannot move a LUN across SVMs. LUNs moved across volumes within an SVM are moved immediately and without loss of connectivity.

.Before you begin

If your LUN is using Selective LUN Map (SLM), you should link:modify-slm-reporting-nodes-task.html[modify the SLM reporting-nodes list] to include the destination node and its HA partner before you move your LUN.

.About this task

Storage efficiency features, such as deduplication, compression, and compaction are not preserved during a LUN move. They must be reapplied after the LUN move is completed.

Data protection through snapshots occurs at the volume level. Therefore, when you move a LUN, it falls under the data protection scheme of the destination volume. If you do not have snapshots established for the destination volume, snapshots of the LUN are not created. Also, all of the snapshots of the LUN stay in the original volume until those snapshots are deleted.

You cannot move a LUN to the following volumes:

* A SnapMirror destination volume
* The SVM root volume

You cannot move the following types of LUNs:

* A LUN that has been created from a file
* A LUN that is in NVFail state
* A LUN that is in a load-sharing relationship
* A protocol-endpoint class LUN

[NOTE]
====
For Solaris os_type LUNs that are 1 TB or larger, the host might experience a timeout during the LUN move. For this LUN type, you should unmount the LUN before initiating the move.

.System Manager
--
Move a LUN with ONTAP System Manager (9.7 and later).

Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can use System Manager to create a new volume when you move a single LUN.  In ONTAP 9.8 and 9.9.1, the volume to which you are moving your LUN must exist before you begin the LUN move.

Steps

.	In System Manager, click *Storage>LUNs*.
.	Right click the LUN  you want to move, then click image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon] and select *Move LUN*.
+
In ONTAP 9.10.1, select to move the LUN to *An existing volume* or to a *New volume*.
+
If you select to create a new volume, provide the volume specifications.

.	Click *Move*.
--

.CLI
--
Move a LUN with the ONTAP CLI.

. Move the LUN:
+
[source,cli]
----
lun move start
----
+
During a very brief period, the LUN is visible on both the origin and destination volume. This is expected and is resolved upon completion of the move.

. Track the status of the move and verify successful completion:
+
[source,cli]
----
lun move show
