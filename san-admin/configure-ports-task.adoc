To configure the unified target adapter (X1143A-R6), you must configure the two adjacent ports on the same chip in the same personality mode.

.Steps

. Configure the ports as needed for Fibre Channel (FC) or Converged Network Adapter (CNA) using the `system node hardware unified-connect modify` command.
. Attach the appropriate cables for FC or 10 Gb Ethernet.
. Verify that you have the correct SFP+ installed:
+
`network fcp adapter show -instance -node -adapter`
+
For CNA, you should use a 10Gb Ethernet SFP. For FC, you should either use an 8 Gb SFP or a 16 Gb SFP, based on the FC fabric being connected to.
+
