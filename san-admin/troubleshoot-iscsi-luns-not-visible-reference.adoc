[.lead]
The iSCSI LUNs appear as local disks to the host. If the storage system LUNs are not available as disks on the host, you should verify the configuration settings.

| Configuration setting| What to do
a|
Cabling
a|
Verify that the cables between the host and storage system are properly connected.
a|
Network connectivity
a|
Verify that there is TCP/IP connectivity between the host and storage system.

* From the storage system command line, ping the host interfaces that are being used for iSCSI:
+
`ping –node _node_name_ -destination _host_ip_address_for_iSCSI_`
* From the host command line, ping the storage system interfaces that are being used for iSCSI:
+
`ping –node _node_name_ -destination _host_ip_address_for_iSCSI_`

System requirements
a|
Verify that the components of your configuration are qualified. Also, verify that you have the correct host operating system (OS) service pack level, initiator version, ONTAP version, and other system requirements. The Interoperability Matrix contains the most up-to-date system requirements.
a|
Jumbo frames
a|
If you are using jumbo frames in your configuration, verify that jumbo frames are enabled on all devices in the network path: the host Ethernet NIC, the storage system, and any switches.
a|
iSCSI service status
a|
Verify that the iSCSI service is licensed and started on the storage system.
a|
Initiator login
a|
Verify that the initiator is logged in to the storage system. If the `iscsi initiator show` command output shows no initiators are logged in, check the initiator configuration on the host. Also verify that the storage system is configured as a target of the initiator.
a|
iSCSI node names (IQNs)
a|
Verify that you are using the correct initiator node names in the igroup configuration. On the host, you can use the initiator tools and commands to display the initiator node name. The initiator node names configured in the igroup and on the host must match.
a|
LUN mappings
a|
Verify that the LUNs are mapped to an igroup. On the storage system console, you can use one of the following commands:

* `lun mapping show` displays all LUNs and the igroups to which they are mapped.
* `lun mapping show -igroup` displays the LUNs mapped to a specific igroup.

a|
iSCSI LIFs enable
a|
Verify that the iSCSI logical interfaces are enabled.
