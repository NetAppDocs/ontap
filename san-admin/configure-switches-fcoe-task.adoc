[.lead]
You must configure your switches for FCoE before your FC service can run over the existing Ethernet infrastructure.

.What you'll need

* Your SAN configuration must be supported.
+
For more information about supported configurations, see the Interoperability Matrix.

* A Unified Target Adapter (UTA) must be installed on your storage system.
+
If you are using a UTA2, it must be set to `cna` mode.

* A converged network adapter (CNA) must be installed on your host.

.Steps

. Use your switch documentation to configure your switches for FCoE.
. Use the `dcb show` command to verify that the DCB settings for each node in the cluster have been correctly configured.
+
`run -node node1 -command dcb show`
+
DCB settings are configured on the switch. Consult your switch documentation if the settings are incorrect.

. Use the `fcp adapter show` command to verify that the FCoE login is working when the FC target port online status is `true`.
+
`cluster1::> fcp adapter show -fields node,adapter,status,state,speed,fabric-established,physical-protocol`
+
If the FC target port online status is `false`, consult your switch documentation.
