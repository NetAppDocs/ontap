[.lead]
You must configure your switches for FCoE before your FC service can run over the existing Ethernet infrastructure.

.Before you begin

* Your SAN configuration must be supported.
+
For more information about supported configurations, see the https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^].

* A Unified Target Adapter (UTA) must be installed on your storage system.
+
If you are using a UTA2, it must be set to `cna` mode.

* A converged network adapter (CNA) must be installed on your host.

.Steps

. Use your switch documentation to configure your switches for FCoE.
. Verify that the DCB settings for each node in the cluster have been correctly configured.
+
[source,cli]
----
run -node node1 -command dcb show
----
+
DCB settings are configured on the switch. Consult your switch documentation if the settings are incorrect.

. Verify that the FCoE login is working when the FC target port online status is `true`.
+
[source,cli]
----
fcp adapter show -fields node,adapter,status,state,speed,fabric-established,physical-protocol
----
+
If the FC target port online status is `false`, consult your switch documentation.
