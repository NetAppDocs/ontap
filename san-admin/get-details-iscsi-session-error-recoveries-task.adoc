Increasing the iSCSI session error recovery level enables you to receive more detailed information about iSCSI error recoveries. Using a higher error recovery level might cause a minor reduction in iSCSI session performance.

.About this task

By default, ONTAP is configured to use error recovery level 0 for iSCSI sessions. If you are using an initiator that has been qualified for error recovery level 1 or 2, you can choose to increase the error recovery level. The modified session error recovery level affects only the newly created sessions and does not affect existing sessions.

Beginning in ONTAP 9.4, the `max-error-recovery-level` option is not supported in the `iscsi show` and `iscsi modify` commands.

.Steps

. Enter advanced mode:
+
`set -privilege advanced`
. Verify the current setting by using the `iscsi show` command.
+
`iscsi show -vserver vs3 -fields max-error-recovery-level`
+
----
vserver max-error-recovery-level
------- ------------------------
vs3     0
----

. Change the error recovery level by using the `iscsi modify` command.
+
`iscsi modify -vserver vs3 -max-error-recovery-level 2`
