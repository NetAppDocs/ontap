You need to be aware of certain considerations when adding nodes to a cluster.

* You must create LIFs on the new nodes as appropriate before you create LUNs on those new nodes.
* You must discover those LIFs from the hosts as dictated by the host stack and protocol.
* You must create LIFs on the new nodes so that the LUN and volume movements are possible without using the cluster interconnect network.
