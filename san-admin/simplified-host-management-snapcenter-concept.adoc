You can use SnapCenter software to simplify some of the management and data protection tasks associated with iSCSI and FC storage. SnapCenter is an optional management package for Windows and UNIX hosts.

You can use SnapCenter Software to easily create virtual disks from pools of storage that can be distributed among several storage systems and to automate storage provisioning tasks and simplify the process of creating Snapshot copies and clones from Snapshot copies consistent with host data.

See NetApp product documentation for more information on SnapCenter.
