You can delete an iSCSI service for a storage virtual machine (SVM) if it is no longer required.

.Before you begin

The administration status of the iSCSI service must be in the "`down`" state before you can delete an iSCSI service. You can move the administration status to down with the `vserver iscsi modify` command.

.Steps

. Use the `vserver iscsi modify` command to stop the I/O to the LUN.
+
`vserver iscsi modify -vserver vs1 -status-admin down`

. Use the `vserver iscsi delete` command to remove the iscsi service from the SVM.
+
`vserver iscsi delete -vserver vs_1`

. Use the `vserver iscsi show command` to verify that you deleted the iSCSI service from the SVM.
+
`vserver iscsi show -vserver vs1`
