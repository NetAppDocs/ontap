summary: "Snapshots are created of the volume. Therefore, if you copy or move a LUN to a different volume, the moved LUN or LUN copy will fall under the data protection scheme of the destination volume. If you do not have snapshots established for the destination volume, snapshots will not be created of the LUN or LUN copy on that volume."

[.lead]
snapshots are created at the volume level.  If you copy or move a LUN to a different volume, the snapshot policy of the destination volume is applied to the copied or moved volume. If snapshots are not established for the destination volume, snapshots will not be created of the moved or copied LUN.
