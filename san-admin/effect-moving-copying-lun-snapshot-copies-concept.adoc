summary: "Snapshot copies are created of the volume. Therefore, if you copy or move a LUN to a different volume, the moved LUN or LUN copy will fall under the data protection scheme of the destination volume. If you do not have Snapshot copies established for the destination volume, Snapshot copies will not be created of the LUN or LUN copy on that volume."
