[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can use System Manager to assign or remove Quality of Service (QoS) policies on multiple LUNs at the same time.

NOTE: If the QoS policy is assigned at the volume level, it must be changed at the volume level.  You can only edit the QoS policy at the LUN level if it was originally assigned at the LUN level.

.Steps

.	In System Manager, click *Storage > LUNs*.

.	Select the LUN or LUNs you want to edit.
+
If you are editing more than one LUN at a time, the LUNs must belong to the same Storage Virtual Machine (SVM). If you select LUNs that do not belong to the same SVM, the option to edit the QoS Policy Group is not displayed.

.	Click *More* and select *Edit QoS Policy Group*.
