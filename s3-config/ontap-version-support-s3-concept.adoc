[.lead]
ONTAP supports S3 object storage for on-premises environments beginning with ONTAP 9.8. Cloud Volumes ONTAP supports S3 object storage for cloud environments beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1.

== S3 support with MetroCluster
Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can enable an S3 object storage server on an SVM in a mirrored aggregate in MetroCluster IP and FC configurations. 

Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, you can enable an S3 object storage server on an SVM in an unmirrored aggregate in a MetroCluster IP configuration. For more information on the limitations of unmirrored aggregates in MetroCluster IP configurations, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/install-ip/considerations_unmirrored_aggrs.html?q=unmirrored+aggregates[Considerations for unmirrored aggregates].

== S3 support with Cloud Volumes ONTAP

ONTAP S3 is configured and functions the same in Cloud Volumes ONTAP as in on-premises environments, with one exception:

* Underlying aggregates should be from one node only. Learn more about link:create-svm-s3-task.html[bucket creation in CVO environments].

== S3 public preview in ONTAP 9.7

In ONTAP 9.7, S3 object storage was introduced as a public preview. That version was not intended for production environments and will no longer be updated as of ONTAP 9.8. Only ONTAP 9.8 and later releases support S3 object storage in production environments.

S3 buckets created with the 9.7 public preview can be used in ONTAP 9.8 and later, but cannot take advantage of feature enhancements. If you have buckets created with the 9.7 public preview, you should migrate the contents of those buckets to 9.8 buckets for feature support, security, and performance enhancements.
