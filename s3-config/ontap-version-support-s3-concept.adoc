= ONTAP version and platform support for S3 object storage
:icons: font

[.lead]
S3 object storage is supported on all AFF, FAS, and ONTAP Select platforms using ONTAP 9.8 and later.

As with other protocols such as FC, iSCSI, NFS, NVMe_oF, and SMB, S3 requires the installation of a
license before it can be used in ONTAP. The S3 license is a zero-cost license, but it must be installed on
systems upgrading to ONTAP 9.8. The S3 license can be downloaded from the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/systems/master-license-keys/ontaps3[Master License Keys page^] on the NetApp support site.

New ONTAP 9.8 and later systems have the S3 license pre-installed.

== Cloud Volumes ONTAP
ONTAP S3 is configured and functions the same in Cloud Volumes ONTAP as in on-premises environments, with one exception:

* When creating buckets in Cloud Volumes ONTAP, you should use the CLI procedure to make sure the underlying FlexGroup volume only uses aggregates from a single node. Using aggregates from multiple nodes will impact performance because the nodes will be in geographically separated availability zones and susceptible to latency issues.

== Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP 
S3 object storage is supported on Amazon FSx for NetApp services using ONTAP 9.11 and later.

== S3 support with MetroCluster
Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can enable an S3 object storage server on an SVM in a mirrored aggregate in MetroCluster IP and FC configurations. 

Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, you can enable an S3 object storage server on an SVM in an unmirrored aggregate in a MetroCluster IP configuration. For more information on the limitations of unmirrored aggregates in MetroCluster IP configurations, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/install-ip/considerations_unmirrored_aggrs.html[Considerations for unmirrored aggregates^].

== S3 public preview in ONTAP 9.7
In ONTAP 9.7, S3 object storage was introduced as a public preview. That version was not intended for production environments and will no longer be updated as of ONTAP 9.8. Only ONTAP 9.8 and later releases support S3 object storage in production environments.

S3 buckets created with the 9.7 public preview can be used in ONTAP 9.8 and later, but cannot take advantage of feature enhancements. If you have buckets created with the 9.7 public preview, you should migrate the contents of those buckets to 9.8 buckets for feature support, security, and performance enhancements.
