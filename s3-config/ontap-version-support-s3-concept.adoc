In ONTAP 9.7, S3 object storage was introduced as a public preview. That version was not intended for production environments and will no longer be updated as of ONTAP 9.8. Only ONTAP 9.8 and later releases support S3 object storage in production environments.

S3 buckets created with the 9.7 public preview can be used in ONTAP 9.8 and later, but cannot take advantage of feature enhancements. If you have buckets created with the 9.7 public preview, you should migrate the contents of those buckets to 9.8 buckets for feature support, security, and performance enhancements.

In ONTAP 9.9.1 and later releases, ONTAP S3 is supported with Cloud Volumes ONTAP for Azure, but not for AWS or Google Cloud.
