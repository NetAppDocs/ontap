You can simplify bucket access by creating groups of users with appropriate access authorizations.

.Before you begin

S3 users in an S3-enabled SVM must already exist.

.About this task

Users in an S3 group can be granted access to any bucket in an SVM but not in multiple SVMs. Group access permissions can be configured in two ways:

* At the bucket level
+
After creating a group of S3 users, you specify group permissions in bucket policy statements and they apply only to that bucket.

* At the SVM level
+
After creating a group of S3 users, you specify object server policy names in the group definition. Those policies determine the buckets and access for the group members.

. Edit the storage VM: click *Storage > storage VMs*, click the storage VM, click *Settings* and then click image:icon_pencil.gif[Edit icon] under S3.
. Add a group: select *Groups*, then select *Add*.
. Enter a group name and select from a list of users.
. You can select an existing group policy or add one now, or you can add a policy later.

.CLI
--
. Create an S3 group:
`vserver object-store-server group create -vserver _svm_name_ -name _group_name_ -users _user_name\(s\)_ [-policies _policy_names_] [-comment _text_\]`
The `-policies` option can be omitted in configurations with only one bucket in an object store; the group name can be added to the bucket policy.
The `-policies` option can be added later with the `vserver object-store-server group modify` command after object storage server policies are created.
