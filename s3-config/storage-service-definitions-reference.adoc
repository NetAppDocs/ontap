ONTAP includes predefined storage services that are mapped to corresponding minimum performance factors.

The actual set of storage services available in a cluster or SVM is determined by the type of storage that makes up an aggregate in the SVM.

The following table shows how the minimum performance factors are mapped to the predefined storage services:
