[.lead]
ONTAP S3 actions are supported by standard S3 REST APIs except as indicated below. For details, see the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Type_API_Reference.html[Amazon S3 API Reference^].

[NOTE]
These S3 actions are specifically supported when using native S3 buckets in ONTAP. Some of these actions, such as those associated with versioning, object locks, and other capabilities, are not supported when using link:../s3-multiprotocol/index.html[S3 NAS buckets (S3 in multiprotocol NAS volumes)].

== Bucket operations

The following operations are supported in ONTAP using AWS S3 APIs:

[options="header"]
|===
| Bucket operation | ONTAP support beginning with 
| CreateBucket | ONTAP 9.11.1
| DeleteBucket | ONTAP 9.11.1
| DeleteBucketPolicy | ONTAP 9.12.1
| GetBucketAcl | ONTAP 9.8
| GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration | ONTAP 9.13.1 +
* only expiration actions are supported
| GetBucketLocation | ONTAP 9.10.1
| GetBucketPolicy | ONTAP 9.12.1 
| HeadBucket | ONTAP 9.8
| ListBuckets | ONTAP 9.8
| ListBucketVersioning | ONTAP 9.11.1
| ListObjectVersions | ONTAP 9.11.1
| PutBucket 
a| * ONTAP 9.11.1
* ONTAP 9.8 - supported with ONTAP REST APIs only
| PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration | ONTAP 9.13.1 +
* only expiration actions are supported
| PutBucketPolicy | ONTAP 9.12.1 


|===

== Object operations

Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, ONTAP S3 supports object metadata and tagging.

* PutObject and CreateMultipartUpload include key-value pairs using `x-amz-meta-<key>.`
+
For example: `x-amz-meta-project: ontap_s3`.

* GetObject. and HeadObject return user-defined metadata.
* Unlike metadata, tags can be read independently of objects using:
 ** PutObjectTagging
 ** GetObjectTagging
 ** DeleteObjectTagging

Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, ONTAP S3 supports object versioning and associated actions with these ONTAP APIs:

 * GetBucketVersioning
 * ListBucketVersions
 * PutBucketVersioning

[options="header"]
|===
| Object operation | ONTAP support beginning with 
| AbortMultipartUpload |ONTAP 9.8
| CompleteMultipartUpload |ONTAP 9.8
| CopyObject | ONTAP 9.12.1
| CreateMultipartUpload |ONTAP 9.8
| DeleteObject |ONTAP 9.8
| DeleteObjects | ONTAP 9.11.1 
| DeleteObjectTagging | ONTAP 9.9.1
| GetBucketVersioning | ONTAP 9.11.1

| PutObject |ONTAP 9.8
| PutObjectLockConfiguration | ONTAP 9.14.1
| PutObjectRetention | ONTAP 9.14.1
| PutObjectTagging | ONTAP 9.9.1
| UploadPart | ONTAP 9.8
| UploadPartCopy | ONTAP 9.12.1

== Group policies

These operations are not specific to S3 and are generally associated with Identity and Management (IAM) processes. ONTAP supports these commands but does not use the IAM REST APIs.

* Create Policy
* AttachGroup Policy

== User management

These operations are not specific to S3 and are generally associated with IAM processes.

* CreateUser
* DeleteUser
* CreateGroup
* DeleteGroup

== S3 actions by release

.ONTAP 9.14.1

ONTAP 9.14.1 adds support for S3 Object Lock.

[NOTE] 
Legal hold operations (locks without defined retention times) are not supported.

* GetObjectLockConfiguration
* GetObjectRetention
* PutObjectLockConfiguration
* PutObjectRetention

.ONTAP 9.13.1

ONTAP 9.13.1 adds support for bucket lifecycle management.

* DeleteBucketLifecycleConfiguration
* GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration
* PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration

.ONTAP 9.12.1

ONTAP 9.12.1 adds support for bucket policies and the ability to copy objects.

* DeleteBucketPolicy
* GetBucketPolicy
* PutBucketPolicy
* CopyObject
* UploadPartCopy

.ONTAP 9.11.1

ONTAP 9.11.1 adds support for versioning, presigned URLs, chunked uploads, and support for common 
S3 actions such as creating and deleting buckets using S3 APIs.

* ONTAP S3 now supports chunked uploads signing requests using x-amz-content-sha256: 
STREAMING-AWS4-HMAC-SHA256-PAYLOAD
* ONTAP S3 now supports client applications using presigned URLs to share objects or allow other 
users to upload objects without requiring user credentials.
* CreateBucket
* DeleteBucket
* GetBucketVersioning
* ListBucketVersions
* PutBucket
* PutBucketVersioning
* DeleteObjects
* ListObjectVersions

[NOTE] 
Because the underlying FlexGroup is not created until the first bucket is, a bucket must first 
be created in ONTAP before an external client can create a bucket using CreateBucket.

.ONTAP 9.10.1

ONTAP 9.10.1 adds support for SnapMirror S3 and GetBucketLocation.

* GetBucketLocation

.ONTAP 9.9.1

ONTAP 9.9.1 adds support for object metadata and tagging support to ONTAP S3.

* PutObject and CreateMultipartUpload now include key-value pairs using 'x-amz-meta-<key>'. For 
example: 'x-amz-meta-project: ontap_s3'.
* GetObject and HeadObject now return user-defined metadata.

Tags can also be used with buckets. Unlike metadata, tags can be read independently of objects 
using:

* PutObjectTagging
* GetObjectTagging
* DeleteObjectTagging
