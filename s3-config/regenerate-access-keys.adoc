Access keys and secret keys are automatically generated during user creation for enabling S3 client access. You can regenerate keys for a user if a key is expired or compromised.

For information about generation of access keys, see link:../s3-config/create-s3-user-task.html[Create an S3 user].

. Regenerate access and secret keys for a user by running the `vserver object-store-server user regenerate-keys` command.
. By default, generated keys are valid indefinitely. Beginning with 9.14.1, you can modify their retention period, after which the keys automatically expire. You can add the retention period in this format: `P[<integer>D]T[<integer>H][<integer>M][<integer>S] | P<integer>W`
For example, if you want to enter a retention period of one day, two hours, three minutes, and four seconds, enter the value as `P1DT2H3M4S`.
