The primary use cases for S3 in ONTAP are:


* Using FabricPool to tier inactive data to a bucket in ONTAP, allowing for ONTAP to ONTAP tiering. Tiering to a bucket within the link:enable-ontap-s3-access-local-fabricpool-task.html[local cluster]—or tiering to a bucket on a link:enable-ontap-s3-access-remote-fabricpool-task.html[remote cluster]—are both supported.
Tiering to ONTAP S3 lets you use less expensive ONTAP systems for inactive data and save money on new flash capacity without the need for additional FabricPool licenses or new technologies to manage.

* Beginning in ONTAP 9.12.1, the S3 protocol can also be enabled in link:../s3-multiprotocol/index.html[multiprotocol NAS volumes] that have been preconfigured to use NAS protocols. When the S3 protocol is enabled in multiprotocol NAS volumes, client applications can read and write data using S3, NFS, and SMB, which opens up a variety of additional use cases. 
One of the most common use cases is NAS clients writing data to a volume and S3 clients reading the same data and performing specialized tasks such as analytics, business intelligence, machine learning, and optical character recognition.

NOTE: ONTAP S3 is appropriate if you want to enable S3 capabilities on existing ONTAP clusters without additional hardware and management. NetApp StorageGRID is NetApp's flagship solution for object storage. StorageGRID is recommended for native S3 applications that need to take advantage of the full range of S3 actions, advanced ILM capabilities, or capacities not achievable in ONTAP-based systems.
