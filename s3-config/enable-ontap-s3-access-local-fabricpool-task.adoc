For ONTAP S3 to be used as a local FabricPool capacity tier, you must define an object store based on the bucket you created, and then attach the object store to a performance tier aggregate to create a FabricPool.

.Before you begin

You must have the ONTAP S3 server name and a bucket name, and the S3 server must have been created using cluster LIFs (with the `-vserver Cluster` parameter).

.About this task

The object-store configuration contains information about the local capacity tier, including the S3 server and bucket names and authentication requirements.

An object-store configuration once created must not be reassociated with a different object-store or bucket. You can create multiple buckets for local tiers, but you cannot create multiple object stores in a single bucket.

A FabricPool license is not required for a local capacity tier.

.Steps

. Create the object store for the local capacity tier:
+
`storage aggregate object-store config create -object-store-name _store_name_ -ipspace Cluster -provider-type ONTAP_S3 -server _S3_server_name_ -container-name _bucket_name_ -access-key _access_key_ -secret-password password`

 ** The `-container-name` is the S3 bucket you created.
 ** The `-access-key` parameter authorizes requests to the ONTAP S3 server.
 ** The `-secret-password` parameter (secret access key) authenticates requests to the ONTAP S3 server.
 ** You can set the `-is-certificate-validation-enabled` parameter to `false` to disable certificate checking for ONTAP S3.

cluster1::> storage aggregate object-store config create
-object-store-name MyLocalObjStore -ipspace Cluster -provider-type ONTAP_S3 -server s3.example.com
-container-name bucket1 -access-key myS3key -secret-password myS3pass

. Display and verify the object store configuration information:
+
`storage aggregate object-store config show`
. Optional: link:../fabricpool/determine-data-inactive-reporting-task.html[Determine how much data in a volume is inactive by using inactive data reporting].
+
Seeing how much data in a volume is inactive can help you decide which aggregate to use for FabricPool local tiering.

. Attach the object store to an aggregate:
+
`storage aggregate object-store attach -aggregate _aggr_name_ -object-store-name _store_name_`
+
You can use the `allow-flexgroup *true*` option to attach aggregates that contain FlexGroup volume constituents.

cluster1::> storage aggregate object-store attach
-aggregate aggr1 -object-store-name MyLocalObjStore

. Display the object store information and verify that the attached object store is available:
+
`storage aggregate object-store show`
+

cluster1::> storage aggregate object-store show
