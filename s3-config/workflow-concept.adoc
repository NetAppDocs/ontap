Configuring S3 involves assessing physical storage and networking requirements, and then choosing a workflow that is specific to your goal--configuring S3 access to a new or existing SVM, or adding a bucket and users to an existing SVM that is already fully configured for S3 access.

NOTE: Network Time Protocol (NTP) configuration is required to ensure time is synchronized between clusters and clients. A valid timestamp of at least 15 minutes difference between the ONTAP S3 object store and the client is often required for client access. link:../system-admin/manage-cluster-time-concept.html[Learn about how to configure NTP].
