Before providing S3 storage to clients, you must verify that networking is correctly configured to meet the S3 provisioning requirements.

.Before you begin

The following cluster networking objects must be configured:

* Physical and logical ports
* Broadcast domains
* Subnets (if required)
* IPspaces (as required, in addition to the default IPspace)
* Failover groups (as required, in addition to the default failover group for each broadcast domain)
* External firewalls

.About this task

For remote FabricPool capacity (cloud) tiers and remote S3 clients, you must use a data SVM and configure data LIFs. For FabricPool cloud tiers, you must also configure intercluster LIFs; cluster peering is not required.

For local FabricPool capacity tiers, you must use the system SVM (called "`Cluster`"), but you have two options for LIF configuration:

* You can use the cluster LIFs.
+
In this option, no further LIF configuration is required, but there will be an increase in traffic on the cluster LIFs. Also, the local tier will not be accessible to other clusters.

* You can use data and intercluster LIFs.
+
This option requires additional configuration, including enabling the LIFs for the S3 protocol, but the local tier will also be accessible as a remote FabricPool cloud tier to other clusters.

.Steps

. Display the available physical and virtual ports:
+
`network port show`

 ** When possible, you should use the port with the highest speed for the data network.
 ** All components in the data network must have the same MTU setting for best performance.
. If you are planning to use a subnet name to allocate the IP address and network mask value for a LIF, verify that the subnet exists and has sufficient addresses available:
+
`network subnet show`
+
Subnets contain a pool of IP addresses that belong to the same layer 3 subnet. Subnets are created by using the `network subnet create` command.

. Display available IPspaces:
+
`network ipspace show`
+
You can use the default IPspace or a custom IPspace.

. If you want to use IPv6 addresses, verify that IPv6 is enabled on the cluster:
+
`network options ipv6 show`
+
If required, you can enable IPv6 by using the `network options ipv6 modify` command.
