You should be aware of certain usage limits and potential performance impacts associated with implementing File System Analytics.

== Supported volume types

File System Analytics is designed to provide visibility on volumes with active NAS data, with the exception of FlexCache caches and Snapmirror destination volumes.

== Potential performance impacts

Enabling File System Analytics may incur a performance impact during the initial metadata collection. Do not enable analytics on the systems that are at a maximum utilization.

ONTAP System Manager provides xref:../concept_cluster_performance_overview.adoc[performance monitoring tools] to manage cluster health and metrics. If you identify impacts to the performance of your monitored volumes, you can disable analytics if your testing shows that the performance impact is unacceptable.

*SVM protected relationships*

If you have enabled File System Analytics on volumes whose containing SVM is in a protection relationship, the analytics data is not replicated to the destination SVM. If the source SVM must be resynchronized in a recovery operation, you must manually reenable analytics on desired volumes after recovery.
