Beginning in ONTAP 9.12.1, you can enable usage analytics to see which directories within a volume are using the most space. You can view the total number of directories in a volume or the total number of files in a volume. Reporting is limited to the 25 directories that use the most space. 

Analytics for large directories refresh every 15 minutes. You can monitor the most recent refresh by checking the Last Refreshed timestamp at the top of the page. You can also click the Download button to download data to an Excel workbook. The download operation runs in the background and presents the most recently reported information for the selected volume. If the scan returns without any results, ensure the volume is online. Events such as SnapRestore will cause File System Analytics to rebuild its list of large directories.

.Steps
. Select *Storage > Volumes*. Select the desired volume.
. From the individual volume menu, select *File System*. Then select the *Usage* tab. 
. Toggle the *Analytics* switch to enable usage analytics.  
. System Manager will display a bar graph identifying the directories with the largest size in descending order.

[NOTE]
ONTAP might display partial data or no data at all while the list of top directories is being collected. The progress of the scan can be in the *Usage* tab that displays during the scan.
