Create or modify storage VMs to enable NFS and SMB servers to serve data to Linux and Windows clients.

Enable a new or existing storage VM to serve both NFS and SMB protocols using this procedure.

//Question: Is it necessary to create a new export policy for the root volume, or should we modify the default policy?

.Before you begin
Ensure that you have noted the configuration details for any networking, authentication, or security services required in your environment.

.Steps

. Enable NFS and SMB on a storage VM.

.. For new storage VMs: click *Storage > Storage VMs*, click *Add*, enter a storage VM name, and in the *SMB/CIFS, NFS, S3* tab, select *Enable SMB/CIFS* and *Enable NFS*.

.. Enter the following information:
* Administrator name and password
* Server name
* Active directory domain
.. Confirm the Organizational Unit.
.. Confirm the DNS values.
.. Confirm the default language.
.. Add network interfaces.
.. Update storage VM administrator account information (optional).

.. For existing storage VMs: click *Storage > Storage VMs*, select a storage VM, and then click *Settings*. Complete the following sub-steps if NFS or SMB is not already enabled.

* Click image:icon_gear.gif[Actions icon] under *NFS*.
* Click image:icon_gear.gif[Actions icon] under *SMB*.


. Open the export policy of the storage VM root volume:

.. Click *Storage > Volumes*, select the root volume of the storage VM (which by default is _volume-name_root_), and then click on the policy that is displayed under *Export Policy*.

.. Click *Add* to add a rule.

*** Client specification = `0.0.0.0/0`

*** Access protocols = NFS

*** Access details = NFS Read-Only

. Configure DNS for host-name resolution:

.. Click *Storage > Storage VMs*, select the storage VM, click *Settings*, and then click image:icon_gear.gif[Actions icon] under *DNS*.

.. When DNS configuration is complete, switch to the DNS server and map the SMB server.

*** Create forward (A - Address record) and reverse (PTR - Pointer record) lookup entries to map the SMB server name to the IP address of the data network interface.

*** If you use NetBIOS aliases, create an alias canonical name (CNAME resource record) lookup entry to map each alias to the IP address of the SMB server's data network interface.

. Configure name services as required:

.. Click *Storage > Storage VMs*, select the storage VM, click *Settings*, and then click image:icon_gear.gif[Actions icon] for LDAP or NIS.

.. Include any changes in the name services switch file: click image:icon_pencil.gif[Edit icon] under *Name Services Switch*.

. Configure Kerberos if required:

.. Click *Storage > Storage VMs*, select the storage VM, and then click *Settings*.

.. Click image:icon_arrow.gif[Arrow icon] in the Kerberos tile and then click *Add*.

. Map UNIX and Windows user names if required: click image:icon_arrow.gif[Arrow icon] under *Name Mapping* and then click *Add*.

You should do this only if your site has Windows and UNIX user accounts that do not map implicitly, which is when the lowercase version of each Windows user name matches the UNIX user name. You can map user names using LDAP, NIS, or local users. If you have two sets of users that do not match, you should configure name mapping.
