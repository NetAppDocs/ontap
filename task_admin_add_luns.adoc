.Before you Start

A storage VM that is configured for SAN service should exist in the cluster.

.Steps

.	Go to *Storage > LUNs*.

.	Click image:icon_add.gif[Add icon].

. Specify a prefix that will be used at the start of each LUN name. (If you are creating only one LUN, enter the LUN name.)

. Select a storage VM from the pull-down list.
+
Only storage VMs that are configured for the SAN protocol are listed.  If only one storage VM that is configured for the SAN protocol is available, then the *Storage VM* field is not displayed.

. Indicate how many LUNs you want to create and the size of each LUN.

. Select the host operating system and LUN format from the pull-down lists.

. Enter the host initiators, and separate them with commas.

. Perform one of the following actions:

|===

h|Click this button...  h|To perform this action...

|*Save*
|The LUNs are created with the specifications you entered.  System defaults are used for other specifications. No additional steps are required.

|*More Options*
|Proceed to <<step9-define-add-specs>> to define additional specifications for the LUNs.

|===

. [[step9-define-add-specs,Step 9]] The LUN prefix is already shown if you previously entered it, but you can modify it. Otherwise, enter the prefix.

. Select a storage VM from the pull-down list.
+
Only storage VMs that are configured for the SAN protocol are listed.  If only one storage VM that is configured for the SAN protocol is available, then the *Storage VM* field is not displayed.

. Determine how you want the LUNs to be grouped:
+
[cols="40,60"]
|===

h|When you make this choice... h|This occurs...

|*Group with related LUNs*
|The LUNs will be grouped together with related LUNs on an existing volume on the storage VM.

|No selection
|The LUNs will be grouped together on a volume called "container".

|===

. In the *Storage and Optimization* section, specify the following values:
+
.. The number and capacity of the LUNs are already shown if you previously entered them, but you can modify them. Otherwise, enter the values.

.. In the *Performance Service Level* field, select a service level:
+
[cols="55,45"]
|===

h|When you select this service level... h|This occurs...

a|An existing service level, such as "Extreme", "Performance", or "Value".

Only the service levels that are valid for the system platform (AFF, FAS, or others) are displayed.
|A local tier is automatically chosen.   Proceed to <<step13>>.

|Custom
|Proceed to <<step12c>> to define a new service level.

|===
+
.. [[step12c, Step 12c]] Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, you can use System Manager to manually select the local tier on which you want to place the LUNs you are creating (if you have selected the "Custom" service level).
+
[cols="55,45"]

h|When you make this choice... h|You perform these steps...

|*Manual placement*
|Manual placement is enabled.  Proceed to <<step12d>> to complete the process.

|No selection
|Manual selection is not enabled.  The local tier is automatically selected.  Proceed to <<step13>>.

|===
+
.. [[step12d, Step 12d]]Select a local tier from the pull-down menu.
+
.. Select a QoS policy.
+
Select "Existing" to choose from a list of existing policies, or select "New" to enter the specifications of a new policy.

. [[step13,Step 13]] In the *Host Information* section, the host operating system and LUN format are already shown, but you can modify them.

. Under *Host Mapping*, select the type of initiators for the LUNs:
+
* *Existing initiator group*:  Select an initiator group for the list that displays.
* *New initiator group using existing initiator groups*:  Specify the name of the new group, and select the group or groups that you want to use to create the new group.
* *Host initiators*: Specify a name from the new initiator group, and click *+Add Initiator* to add initiators to the group.

. In the *Protection* section, specify the protections for the LUNs.
+
If you select *Enable SnapMirror (Local or Remote)*, then specify the protection policy and settings for the destination cluster from the pull-down lists.

. Click *Save*.
+
The LUNs are created and added to the cluster and storage VM.
+
NOTE: You can also save the specifications of these LUNs to an Ansible Playbook.  For more details, go to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/task_use_ansible_playbooks_add_edit_volumes_luns.html[Use Ansible Playbooks to add or edit volumes or LUNs].
