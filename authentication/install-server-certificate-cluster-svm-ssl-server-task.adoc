[.lead]
On production systems, it is a best practice to install a CA-signed digital certificate for use in authenticating the cluster or SVM as an SSL server. You can use the `security certificate generate-csr` command to generate a certificate signing request (CSR), and the `security certificate install` command to install the certificate you receive back from the certificate authority.

== Generate a certificate signing request

You can use the `security certificate generate-csr` command to generate a certificate signing request (CSR). After processing your request, the certificate authority (CA) sends you the signed digital certificate.

.Before you begin

You must be a cluster or SVM administrator to perform this task.

.Steps

. Generate a CSR:
+
[source,cli]
----
security certificate generate-csr -common-name FQDN_or_common_name -size 512|1024|1536|2048 -country country -state state -locality locality -organization organization -unit unit -email-addr email_of_contact -hash-function SHA1|SHA256|MD5
----
+
The following command creates a CSR with a 2048-bit private key generated by the `SHA256` hashing function for use by the `Software` group in the `IT` department of a company whose custom common name is `server1.companyname.com`, located in Sunnyvale, California, USA. The email address of the SVM contact administrator is `web@example.com`. The system displays the CSR and the private key in the output.

----
cluster1::>security certificate generate-csr -common-name server1.companyname.com -size 2048 -country US -state California -locality Sunnyvale -organization IT -unit Software -email-addr web@example.com -hash-function SHA256

Certificate Signing Request :
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
<certificate_value>
-----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----


Private Key :
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
<key_value>
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

NOTE: Keep a copy of your certificate request and private key for future reference.
----
====

. Copy the certificate request from the CSR output, and send it in electronic form (such as email) to a trusted third-party CA for signing.
+
After processing your request, the CA sends you the signed digital certificate. You should keep a copy of the private key and the CA-signed digital certificate.

== Install a CA-signed server certificate

You can use the `security certificate install` command to install a CA-signed server certificate on an SVM. ONTAP prompts you for the certificate authority (CA) root and intermediate certificates that form the certificate chain of the server certificate.

.Before you begin

You must be a cluster or SVM administrator to perform this task.

.Step

. Install a CA-signed server certificate: 
+
[source,cli]
----
security certificate install -vserver SVM_name -type certificate_type
----
+
For complete command syntax, see the link:config-worksheets-reference.html[worksheet].
+
[NOTE]
====
ONTAP prompts you for the CA root and intermediate certificates that form the certificate chain of the server certificate. The chain starts with the certificate of the CA that issued the server certificate, and can range up to the root certificate of the CA. Any missing intermediate certificates result in the failure of server certificate installation.
====
+
The following command installs the CA-signed server certificate and intermediate certificates on SVM `engData2`.

Do you want to continue entering root and/or intermediate certificates {y|n}: y

Please enter Intermediate Certificate: Press <Enter> when done
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<certificate_value>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----


Do you want to continue entering root and/or intermediate certificates {y|n}: y

Please enter Intermediate Certificate: Press <Enter> when done
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<certificate_value>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----


Do you want to continue entering root and/or intermediate certificates {y|n}: n

You should keep a copy of the private key and the CA-signed digital certificate for future reference.
