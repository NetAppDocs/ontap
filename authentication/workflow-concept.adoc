You can enable authentication for local administrator accounts or remote administrator accounts. The account information for a local account resides on the storage system and the account information for a remote account resides elsewhere. Each account can have a predefined role or a custom role.

//image:administrator-authentication-rbac-workflow.gif[Administrator authentication and RBAC workflow]

You can enable local administrator accounts to access an admin storage virtual machine (SVM) or a data SVM with the following types of authentication:

* Password
* SSH public key
* SSL certificate
* SSH multifactor authentication (MFA)
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.3, authentication with password and public key is supported.

You can enable remote administrator accounts to access an admin SVM or a data SVM with the following types of authentication:

* Active Directory
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, you can use an SSH public key as either your primary or secondary authentication method for an Active Directory user.

* SAML authentication (only for admin SVM)
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.3, Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication can be used for accessing the admin SVM by using any of the following web services: Service Processor Infrastructure, ONTAP APIs, or System Manager.

* Beginning with ONTAP 9.4, SSH MFA can be used for remote users on LDAP or NIS servers. Authentication with nsswitch and public key is supported.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Before creating login accounts and setting up role-based access control (RBAC), you should gather information for each item in the configuration worksheets.

*If remote:*

* Determine the type of remote access. Depending on the access type, link:rant-access-active-directory-users-groups-task.html[enable Active Directory access,] link:grant-access-nis-ldap-user-accounts-task.html[enable LDAP or NIS access,] or link:..system-admin/configure-saml-authentication-task.html[configure SAML authentication (only for admin SVM).]

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The role assigned to an administrator determines the commands to which the administrator has access. You assign the role when you create the account for the administrator. You can assign a different role or define custom roles as needed.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Depending on how you have enabled account access, you may need to associate a public key with a local account, install a CA-signed server digital certificate, or configure AD, LDAP, or NIS access. You can perform all of these tasks before or after enabling account access.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, you can use multi-admin verification (MAV) to ensure that certain operations, such as deleting volumes or snapshots, can be executed only after approvals from designated administrators. This prevents compromised, malicious, or inexperienced administrators from making undesirable changes or deleting data.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.15.1, administrators can configure and enable dynamic authorization to increase security of remote access to ONTAP while also mitigating potential damage that could be caused by a malicious actor. With ONTAP 9.15.1, dynamic authorization provides an initial framework for assigning a security score to users and, if their activity looks suspicious, challenging them with additional authorization checks or denying an operation completely.
