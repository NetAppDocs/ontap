You can enable authentication for local administrator accounts or remote administrator accounts. The account information for a local account resides on the storage system and the account information for a remote account resides elsewhere. Each account can have a predefined role or a custom role.

You can enable local administrator accounts to access an admin storage virtual machine (SVM) or a data SVM with the following types of authentication:

* Password
* SSH public key
* SSL certificate
* SSH multifactor authentication (MFA)
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.3, authentication with password and public key is supported.

You can enable remote administrator accounts to access an admin SVM or a data SVM with the following types of authentication:

* Active Directory
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, you can use an SSH public key as either your primary or secondary authentication method for an Active Directory user.

* SAML authentication (only for admin SVM)
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.3, Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication can be used for accessing the admin SVM by using any of the following web services: Service Processor Infrastructure, ONTAP APIs, or System Manager.

* Beginning with ONTAP 9.4, SSH MFA can be used for remote users on LDAP or NIS servers. Authentication with nsswitch and public key is supported.
