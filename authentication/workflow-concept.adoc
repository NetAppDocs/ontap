You can enable authentication for local administrator accounts or remote administrator accounts. The account information for a local account resides on the storage system and the account information for a remote account resides elsewhere. Each account can have a predefined role or a custom role.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Before creating login accounts and setting up role-based access control (RBAC), you should gather information for each item in the link:config-worksheets-reference.html[configuration worksheets].

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* *If local:* Enable link:enable-password-account-access-task.html[password], link:enable-ssh-public-key-accounts-task.html[SSH], link:mfa-overview.html[SSH MFA], or link:enable-ssl-certificate-accounts-task.html[SSL] access.
* *If remote:* Determine the type of remote access. Depending on the access type, link:grant-access-active-directory-users-groups-task.html[enable Active Directory access], link:grant-access-nis-ldap-user-accounts-task.html[enable LDAP or NIS access], or link:../system-admin/configure-saml-authentication-task.html[configure SAML authentication (only for admin SVM)].

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The role assigned to an administrator determines the commands to which the administrator has access. The role is assigned when you create the administrator account and can be link:modify-role-assigned-administrator-task.html[modified] later. You can use predefined roles for link:predefined-roles-cluster-administrators-concept.html[cluster] and link:predefined-roles-svm-administrators-concept.html[SVM] administrators, or link:define-custom-roles-task.html[define custom roles] as needed.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-4.png[Four]Manage administrator accounts
[role="quick-margin-para"]
Depending on how you have enabled account access, you may need to associate a link:manage-public-key-authentication-concept.html[public key with a local account], manage link:manage-ssh-public-keys-and-certificates.html[public keys and X.509 certificates], configure link:configure-cisco-duo-mfa-task.html[Cisco Duo 2FA for SSH logins], install a link:install-server-certificate-cluster-svm-ssl-server-task.html[CA-signed server digital certificate], or configure link:enable-ad-users-groups-access-cluster-svm-task.html[Active Directory], link:enable-nis-ldap-users-access-cluster-task.html[LDAP, or NIS] access. You can perform all of these tasks before or after enabling account access.

* link:dynamic-authorization-overview.html[Manage dynamic authorization] if you want to dynamically apply additional authorization checks based on a user's trust level.
