You can enable authentication for local administrator accounts or remote administrator accounts. The account information for a local account resides on the storage system and the account information for a remote account resides elsewhere. Each account can have a predefined role or a custom role.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Before creating login accounts and setting up role-based access control (RBAC), you should gather information for each item in the configuration worksheets.

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* *If local:* Enable link:enable-password-account-access-task.html[password], link:enable-ssh-public-key-accounts-task.html[SSH], link:mfa-overview.html[SSH MFA], or link:enable-ssl-certificate-accounts-task.html[SSL] access.
* *If remote:* Determine the type of remote access. Depending on the access type, link:grant-access-active-directory-users-groups-task.html[enable Active Directory access], link:grant-access-nis-ldap-user-accounts-task.html[enable LDAP or NIS access], or link:../system-admin/configure-saml-authentication-task.html[configure SAML authentication (only for admin SVM)].

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The role assigned to an administrator determines the commands to which the administrator has access. You assign the role when you create the account for the administrator. You can assign a different role or define custom roles as needed.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Depending on how you have enabled account access, you may need to associate a public key with a local account, install a CA-signed server digital certificate, or configure AD, LDAP, or NIS access. You can perform all of these tasks before or after enabling account access.
