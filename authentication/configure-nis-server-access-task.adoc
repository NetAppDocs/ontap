[.lead]
You must configure NIS server access to an SVM before NIS accounts can access the SVM. You can use the `vserver services name-service nis-domain create` command to create an NIS domain configuration on an SVM.

.What you'll need

* All configured servers must be available and accessible before you configure the NIS domain on the SVM.
* You must be a cluster or SVM administrator to perform this task.

.About this task

You can create multiple NIS domains. Only one NIS domain can be set to `active` at a time.

.Step

. Create an NIS domain configuration on an SVM: `vserver services name-service nis-domain create -vserver SVM_name -domain client_configuration -active true|false -nis-servers NIS_server_IPs`

For complete command syntax, see the link:config-worksheets-reference.html[worksheet].
+
[NOTE]
====
Starting in ONTAP 9.2, the field `-nis-servers` replaces the field `-servers`. This new field can take either a hostname or an IP address for the NIS server.
====
+
The following command creates an NIS domain configuration on the SVM ``engData``. The NIS domain `nisdomain` is active on creation and communicates with an NIS server with the IP address `192.0.2.180`.
