Before creating login accounts and setting up role-based access control (RBAC), you should gather information for each item in the configuration worksheets.

== Create or modify login accounts

You provide these values with the `security login create` command when you enable login accounts to access a storage VM. You provide the same values with the `security login modify` command when you modify how an account accesses a storage VM.

[cols="3*"]
|===

h| Field h| Description h| Your value

a|
`-vserver`
a|
The name of the storage VM that the account accesses. The default value is the name of the admin storage VM for the cluster.
a|

a|
`-user-or-group-name`
a|
The user name or group name of the account. Specifying a group name enables access to each user in the group. You can associate a user name or group name with multiple applications.

a|

a|
`-application`
a|
The application that is used to access the storage VM:

* `http`
* `ontapi`
* `snmp`
* `ssh`

a|

a|
`-authmethod`
a|
The method that is used to authenticate the account:

* `cert` for SSL certificate authentication
* `domain` for Active Directory authentication
* `nsswitch` for LDAP or NIS authentication
* `password` for user password authentication
* `publickey` for public key authentication
* `community` for SNMP community strings
* `usm` for SNMP user security model
* `saml` for Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication

a|

a|
`-remote-switch-ipaddress`
a|
The IP address of the remote switch. The remote switch can be a cluster switch monitored by the cluster switch health monitor (CSHM) or a Fibre Channel (FC) switch monitored by the MetroCluster health monitor (MCC-HM). This option is applicable only when the application is `snmp` and the authentication method is `usm`.
a|

a|
`-role`
a|
The access control role that is assigned to the account:

* For the cluster (the admin storage VM), the default value is `admin`.
* For a data storage VM, the default value is `vsadmin`.

a|

a|
`-comment`
a|
(Optional) Descriptive text for the account. You should enclose the text in double quotation marks (").
a|

a|
`-is-ns-switch-group`
a|
Whether the account is an LDAP group account or NIS group account (`yes` or `no`).
a|

a|
`-second-authentication-method`
a|
Second authentication method in case of multifactor authentication:

* `none` if not using multifactor authentication, default value
* `publickey` for public key authentication when the `authmethod` is password or nsswitch
* `password` for user password authentication when the `authmethod` is public key
* `nsswitch` for user password authentication when the authmethod is publickey

The order of authentication is always the public key followed by the password.
a|

a|
`-is-ldap-fastbind`
a|
Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, when set to true, enables LDAP fast bind for nsswitch authentication; the default is false. To use LDAP fast bind, the `-authentication-method` value must be set to `nsswitch`. link:../nfs-admin/ldap-fast-bind-nsswitch-authentication-task.html[Learn about LDAP fastbind for nsswitch authentication.]

== Configure Cisco Duo security information

You provide these values with the `security login duo create` command when you enable Cisco Duo two-factor authentication with SSH logins for a storage VM.

[cols="3*"]
|===

h| Field h| Description h| Your value

a|
`-vserver`
a|
The storage VM (referred to as a vserver in the ONTAP CLI) to which the Duo authentication settings apply. 
a|

a|
`-integration-key`
a|
Your integration key, obtained when registering your SSH application with Duo.

a|

a|
`-secret-key`
a|
Your secret key, obtained when registering your SSH application with Duo.

a|

a|
`-api-host`
a|
The API hostname, obtained when registering your SSH application with Duo. For example:
----
api-<HOSTNAME>.duosecurity.com
----

a|

a|
`-fail-mode`
a|
On service or configuration errors that prevent Duo authentication, fail `safe` (allow access) or `secure` (deny access). The default is `safe`, which means that Duo authentication is bypassed if it fails due to errors such as the Duo API server being inaccessible. 

a|

a|
`-http-proxy`
a|
Use the specified HTTP proxy. If the HTTP proxy requires authentication, include the credentials in the proxy URL. For example:
----
http-proxy=http://username:password@proxy.example.org:8080
----

a|

a|
`-autopush`
a|
Either `true` or `false`. Default is `false`. If `true`, Duo automatically sends a push login request to the user's phone, reverting to a phone call if push is unavailable. Note that this effectively disables passcode authentication. If `false`, the user is prompted to choose an authentication method.

When configured with `autopush = true`, we recommend setting `max-prompts = 1`.

a|

a|
`-max-prompts`
a|
If a user fails to authenticate with a second factor, Duo prompts the user to authenticate again. This option sets the maximum number of prompts that Duo displays before denying access. Must be `1`, `2`, or `3`. The default value is `1`.

For example, when `max-prompts = 1`, the user needs to successfully authenticate on the first prompt, whereas if `max-prompts = 2`, if the user enters incorrect information at the initial prompt, he/she will be prompted to authenticate again.

When configured with `autopush = true`, we recommend setting `max-prompts = 1`.

For the best experience, a user with only publickey authentication will always have `max-prompts` set to `1`.

a|

// a|
// `-max-unenrolled-logins`
// a|
// NOT SUPPORTED IN INITIAL RELEASE
// 
// The maximum number of times that an unenrolled user is permitted to bypass Duo authentication and use only the primary authentication method to login. For example, if max-unenrolled-logins=3, then ONTAP will allow the user to bypass Duo authentication and login via SSH up to 3 times using only the primary authentication method. SSH login will be disallowed at the 4th attempt if the user is still not yet enrolled in Duo.
//
// By default, max-unenrolled-logins=-1, which means that Duo authentication is bypassed for unenrolled users, and that there is no limit to the number of times an unenrolled user can log in using only the primary authentication method.

// If set to 0, this means that the user cannot login without enrolling with Duo.
// a|

a|
`-enabled`
a|
Enable Duo two-factor authentication. Set to `true` by default. When enabled, Duo two-factor authentication is enforced during SSH login according to the configured parameters. When Duo is disabled (set to `false`), Duo authentication is ignored.

a|

a|
`-pushinfo`
a|
This option provides additional information in the push notification, such as the name of the application or service being accessed. This helps users verify that they are logging in to the correct service and provides an additional layer of security.

a|

|===


== Define custom roles

You provide these values with the `security login role create` command when you define a custom role.

[cols="3*"]
|===

h| Field h| Description h| Your value

(Optional) The name of the storage VM (referred to as a vserver in the ONTAP CLI) that is associated with the role.
a|

a|
`-role`
a|
The name of the role.
a|

a|
`-cmddirname`
a|
The command or command directory to which the role gives access. You should enclose command subdirectory names in double quotation marks ("). For example, `"volume snapshot"`. You must enter `DEFAULT` to specify all command directories.

a|

a|
`-access`
a|
(Optional) The access level for the role. For command directories:

* `none` (the default value for custom roles) denies access to commands in the command directory
* `readonly` grants access to the `show` commands in the command directory and its subdirectories
* `all` grants access to all of the commands in the command directory and its subdirectories

For _nonintrinsic commands_ (commands that do not end in `create`, `modify`, `delete`, or `show`):

* `none` (the default value for custom roles) denies access to the command
* `readonly` is not applicable
* `all` grants access to the command

To grant or deny access to intrinsic commands, you must specify the command directory.

a|

a|
`-query`
a|
(Optional) The query object that is used to filter the access level, which is specified in the form of a valid option for the command or for a command in the command directory. You should enclose the query object in double quotation marks ("). For example, if the command directory is `volume`, the query object `"-aggr aggr0"` would enable access for the `aggr0` aggregate only.
a|

|===

== Associate a public key with a user account

You provide these values with the `security login publickey create` command when you associate an SSH public key with a user account.

[cols="3*"]

a|
The index number of the public key. The default value is 0 if the key is the first key that is created for the account; otherwise, the default value is one more than the highest existing index number for the account.
a|

a|
`-publickey`
a|
The OpenSSH public key. You should enclose the key in double quotation marks (").
a|

a|
`-role`
a|
The access control role that is assigned to the account.
a|

a|
`-comment`
a|
(Optional) Descriptive text for the public key. You should enclose the text in double quotation marks (").
a|

a|
`-x509-certificate`
a|
(Optional) Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, enables you to manage X.509 certificate association with the SSH public key. 

When you associate an X.509 certificate with the SSH public key, ONTAP checks upon SSH login to see if this certificate is valid. If it has expired or been revoked, login is disallowed and the associated SSH public key is disabled. Possible values:

* `install`: Install the specified PEM-encoded X.509 certificate and associate it with the SSH public key. Include the full text for the certificate you want to install.
* `modify`: Update the existing PEM-encoded X.509 certificate with the specified certificate and associate it with the SSH public key. Include the full text for the new certificate.
* `delete`: Remove the existing X.509 certificate association with the SSH public key.

a|The name of the storage VM for which the trust score setting should be modified. If you omit this parameter, the cluster-level setting is used.
a|

a|`-state`
a|The dynamic authorization mode. Possible values:

* `disabled`: (Default) Dynamic authorization is disabled.
* `visibility`: This mode is useful for testing dynamic authorization. In this mode, the trust score is checked with every restricted activity, but not enforced. However, any activity that would have been denied or subject to additional authentication challenges is logged.
* `enforced`: Intended for use after you have completed testing with `visibility` mode. In this mode, the trust score is checked with every restricted activity, and activity restrictions are enforced if the restriction conditions are met. The suppression interval is also enforced, preventing additional authentication challenges within the specified interval.
a|

a|`-suppression-interval`
a|Prevents additional authentication challenges within the specified interval. The interval is in ISO-8601 format and accepts values from 1 minute to 1 hour inclusive. If set to 0, the suppression interval is disabled and the user is always prompted for an authentication challenge if one is needed.
a|

a|`-lower-challenge-boundary`
a|The lower multi-factor authentication (MFA) challenge percentage boundary. The valid range is from 0 to 99. The value 100 is invalid, because this causes all requests to be denied. The default value is 0.
a|

a|`-upper-challenge-boundary`
a|The upper MFA challenge percentage boundary. The valid range is from 0 to 100. This must be equal to or greater than the value of the lower boundary. A value of 100 means that every request will either be denied or subject to an additional authentication challenge; there are no requests that are allowed without a challenge. The default value is 90.
