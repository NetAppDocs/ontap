Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can use System Manager to manage trusted certificate authorities, client/server certificates, and local (onboard) certificate authorities.

With System Manager, you can manage the certificates received from other applications so you can authenticate communications from those applications.  You can also manage your own certificates that identify your system to other applications.
