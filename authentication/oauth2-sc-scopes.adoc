Self-contained scopes are strings carried in the access token. Each is a complete custom role definition and includes everything ONTAP needs to make an access decision. The scope is separate and distinct from any of the REST roles defined within ONTAP itself.

== Format of the scope string

At a base level, the scope is represented as a contiguous string and composed of six colon-separated values. The parameters used in the scope string are described below.

=== ONTAP literal

The scope must begin with the literal value `ontap` in lowercase. This identifies the scope as specific to ONTAP.

=== Cluster

This defines which ONTAP cluster the scope applies to. The values can include:

* Cluster UUID
+
Identifies a single cluster.

* Asterisk (***)
+
Indicates the scope applies to all clusters.

You can use the ONTAP CLI command `cluster identity show` to display the UUID of your cluster. If not specified, the scope applies to all clusters. Learn more about `cluster identity show` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/cluster-identity-show.html[ONTAP command reference^].

=== Role

The name of the REST role contained in the self-contained scope. This value is not examined by ONTAP or matched to any existing REST roles defined to ONTAP. The name is used for logging.

=== Access level

This value indicates the access level applied to the client application when using the API endpoint in the scope. There are six possible values as described in the table below.

[cols="25,75"*,options="header"]
|===
|Access level
|Description
|none
|Denies all access to the specified endpoint.
|readonly
|Allows only read access using GET.
|read_create
|Allows read access as well as the creation of new resource instances using POST.
|read_modify
|Allows read access as well as the ability to update existing resources using PATCH.
|read_create_modify
|Allows all access except delete. The allowed operations include GET (read), POST (create), and PATCH (update).
|all
|Allows full access.
|===

=== SVM

The name of the SVM within the cluster the scope applies to. Use the *** value (asterisk) to indicate all SVMs.

[CAUTION]
This feature is not fully supported with ONTAP 9.14.1. You can ignore the SVM parameter and use an asterisk as a placeholder. Review the https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2492508[ONTAP release notes^] to check for future SVM support.

=== REST API URI

The complete or partial path to a resource or set of related resources. The string must begin with `/api`. If you don't specify a value, the scope applies to all API endpoints at the ONTAP cluster.

== Scope examples

A few examples of self-contained scopes are presented below.

ontap:*:joes-role:read_create_modify:*:/api/cluster::
Provides the user assigned this role read, create, and modify access to the `/cluster` endpoint.

== CLI administrative tool

To make the administration of the self-contained scopes easier and less error-prone, ONTAP provides the CLI command `security oauth2 scope` to generate scope strings based on your input parameters.

The command `security oauth2 scope` has two use cases based on your input:

* CLI parameters to scope string
+
You can use this version of the command to generate a scope string based on the input parameters.

* Scope string to CLI parameters
+
You can use this version of the command to generate the command parameters based on the input scope string.

.Example

The following example generates a scope string with the output included after the command example below. The definition applies to all clusters.
