You can enable local or remote cluster and SVM administrator accounts. A local account is one in which the account information, public key, or security certificate resides on the storage system. AD account information is stored on a domain controller. LDAP and NIS accounts reside on LDAP and NIS servers.

== Cluster and SVM administrators

A _cluster administrator_ accesses the admin SVM for the cluster. The admin SVM and a cluster administrator with the reserved name `admin` are automatically created when the cluster is set up.

A cluster administrator with the default `admin` role can administer the entire cluster and its resources. The cluster administrator can create additional cluster administrators with different roles as needed.

An _SVM administrator_ accesses a data SVM. The cluster administrator creates data SVMs and SVM administrators as needed.

SVM administrators are assigned the `vsadmin` role by default. The cluster administrator can assign different roles to SVM administrators as needed.

=== Naming conventions 

The following generic names cannot be used for remote cluster and SVM administrator accounts:

* "adm"
* "bin"
* "cli"
* "daemon"
* "ftp"
* "games"
* "halt"
* "lp"
* "mail"
* "man"
* "naroot"
* "netapp"
* "news"
* "nobody"
* "operator"
* "root"
* "shutdown"
* "sshd"
* "sync"
* "sys"
* "uucp"
* "www"

== Merged roles

If you enable multiple remote accounts for the same user, the user is assigned the union of all roles specified for the accounts. That is, if an LDAP or NIS account is assigned the `vsadmin` role, and the AD group account for the same user is assigned the `vsadmin-volume` role, the AD user logs in with the more inclusive `vsadmin` capabilities. The roles are said to be _merged_.
