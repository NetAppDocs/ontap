You can use the `security login create` command to enable administrator accounts to access an admin or data SVM with an SSL certificate. Learn more about `security login create` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/security-login-create.html[ONTAP command reference^].

.About this task

* You must install a CA-signed server digital certificate before the account can access the SVM.
+
xref:install-server-certificate-cluster-svm-ssl-server-task.adoc[Generating and installing a CA-signed server certificate]
+
You can perform this task before or after you enable account access.

* If you are unsure of the access control role you want to assign to the login account, you can add the role later with the `security login modify` command.

[NOTE]
For cluster administrator accounts, certificate authentication is supported with the `http`, `ontapi`, and `rest` applications. For SVM administrator accounts, certificate authentication is supported only with the `ontapi` and `rest` applications.

.Step

. Enable local administrator accounts to access an SVM using an SSL certificate:
+
`security login create -vserver SVM_name -user-or-group-name user_or_group_name -application application -authmethod authentication_method -role role -comment comment`
+
The following command enables the SVM administrator account `svmadmin2` with the default `vsadmin` role to access the SVM``engData2`` using an SSL digital certificate.
+
----
cluster1::>security login create -vserver engData2 -user-or-group-name svmadmin2 -application ontapi -authmethod cert
----

.After you finish

If you have not installed a CA-signed server digital certificate, you must do so before the account can access the SVM.
