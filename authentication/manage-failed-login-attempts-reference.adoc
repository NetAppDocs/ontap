Repeated failed login attempts sometimes indicate that an intruder is attempting to access the storage system. You can take a number of steps to ensure that an intrusion does not take place.

== How you will know that login attempts have failed

The Event Management System (EMS) notifies you about failed login attempts every hour. You can find a record of failed login attempts in the `audit.log` file.

== What to do if repeated login attempts fail

In the short term, you can take a number of steps to prevent an intrusion:

* Require that passwords be composed of a minimum number of uppercase characters, lowercase characters, special characters, and/or digits
* Impose a delay after a failed login attempt
* Limit the number of allowed failed login attempts, and lock out users after the specified number of failed attempts
* Expire and lock out accounts that are inactive for a specified number of days

You can use the `security login role config modify` command to perform these tasks. Learn more about `security login role config modify` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/security-login-role-config-modify.html[ONTAP command reference^].

Over the long term, you can take these additional steps:

* Use the `security ssh modify` command to limit the number of failed login attempts for all newly created SVMs. Learn more about `security ssh modify` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/security-ssh-modify.html[ONTAP command reference^].
* Migrate existing MD5-algorithm accounts to the more secure SHA-512 algorithm by requiring users to change their passwords.
