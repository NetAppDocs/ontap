//todo: ONTAP admin or user can elevate privilege? Check diction
Beginning with ONTAP 9.17.1, storage administrators can configure just-in-time (JIT) privilege elevation to allow ONTAP users to temporarily elevate their privileges to perform certain tasks. When JIT is configured for a user, they can temporarily elevate their privilege to a role that has the necessary permissions to perform a task. After the session duration expires, the user returns to their original role.

.About this task
* JIT privilege elevation is only available to users accessing ONTAP with SSH. Elevated privilege is only available within the current SSH session, but you can elevate privileges within as many concurrent SSH sessions as needed.
* JIT privilege elevation is only supported for users using password, nsswitch, or domain authentication to login.
//todo: confirm the above and use the correct terms for password, nsswitch, & domain auth

.Before you begin
* To access JIT privilege elevation, a cluster administrator must link:configure-jit-elevation-task.html[configure JIT access] for your account.

.Steps
. Temporarily elevate your role:
+
[source, cli]
----
security jit-privilege elevate
----
If JIT access is configured for your account, you will be granted elevated access for the configured session duration. After the session duration expires, you will return to your original role.

. View the remaining time in your JIT session:
+
[source, cli]
----
security jit-privilege show-remaining-time
----
If you are currently in a JIT session, this command displays the remaining time in your session.

. End your JIT session early:
+
[source, cli]
----
security jit-privilege reset
----
If you are currently in a JIT session, this command ends the JIT session and restores your original role.
