Beginning with ONTAP 9.17.1, storage administrators can link:configure-jit-elevation-task.html[configure just-in-time (JIT) privilege elevation] to allow ONTAP users to temporarily elevate their privileges to perform certain tasks. When JIT is configured for a user, they can temporarily elevate their privilege to a role that has the necessary permissions to perform a task. After the session duration expires, the user returns to their original role.

Cluster administrators can configure the duration for which a user can access JIT elevation. For example, cluster administrators can configure user access to JIT elevation with a 30 minute per-session limit for a 30 day period. During the 30 day period, the user can elevate their privilege as many times as needed, but each session is limited to 30 minutes.

.About this task
* JIT privilege elevation is only available to users accessing ONTAP with SSH. Elevated privilege is only available within the current SSH session, but you can elevate privileges within as many concurrent SSH sessions as needed.
* JIT privilege elevation is only supported for users using password authentication to login.
* A user's elevated privilege session will be terminated if the configured session or JIT validity period expires, or if a cluster administrator revokes JIT access for the user.

.Before you begin
* To access JIT privilege elevation, a cluster administrator must configure JIT access for your account.

.Steps
. Temporarily elevate your privileges:
+
[source, cli]
----
security jit-privilege elevate
----
If JIT access is configured for your account, you will be granted elevated access for the configured session duration. After the session duration expires, you will return to your original access.

. View the remaining time in your JIT session:
+
[source, cli]
----
security jit-privilege show-remaining-time
----
If you are currently in a JIT session, this command displays the remaining time in your session.

. If needed, end your JIT session early:
+
[source, cli]
----
security jit-privilege reset
----
If you are currently in a JIT session, this command ends the JIT session and restores your original role.
