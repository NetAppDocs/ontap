[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.17.1, cluster administrators can configure just-in-time (JIT) privilege elevation to allow ONTAP users to temporarily elevate their privileges to perform certain tasks. When JIT is configured for a user, they can temporarily link:elevate-jit-access-task.html[elevate their privilege] to a role that has the necessary permissions to perform a task. After the session duration expires, the user returns to their original access level.

Cluster administrators can configure the duration for which a user can access JIT elevation. For example, you can configure user access to JIT elevation with a 30 minute per-session limit (the _session validity period_) for a 30-day period (the _JIT validity period_). During the 30-day period, the user can elevate their privilege as many times as needed, but each session is limited to 30 minutes.

Cluster administrators can set up JIT access for ONTAP users, and configure the default JIT session validity period and maximum JIT validity period globally and for specific SVMs.

.About this task
* JIT privilege elevation is only available to users accessing ONTAP with SSH. Elevated privilege is only available within the user's current SSH session, but they can elevate privileges within as many concurrent SSH sessions as needed.
* JIT privilege elevation is only supported for users using password, nsswitch, or domain authentication to log in. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not supported for JIT privilege elevation.

.Before you begin
* You must be an ONTAP cluster administrator at the `admin` privilege level to perform the following tasks.

== Modify global JIT settings
You can modify the default JIT settings globally or for a specific SVM. These settings determine the default session validity period and the maximum JIT validity period for users who are configured for JIT access.

.About this task
* The default `default-session-validity-period` value is one hour. This setting determines how long a user can access elevated privileges in a JIT session before needing to re-elevate.
* The default `max-jit-validity-period` value is 90 days. This setting determines the maximum period during which a user can access JIT elevation after the configured start date. You can configure the JIT validity period for individual users, but it cannot exceed the maximum JIT validity period.

.Steps

. Check the current JIT settings:
+
[source, cli]
----
security jit-privilege show -vserver <svm_name>
----
`-vserver` is optional. If you don't specify a SVM, the command shows the global JIT settings.

. Modify the JIT settings globally or for an SVM:
+
[source, cli]
----
security jit-privilege modify -vserver <svm_name> -default-session-validity-period <period> -max-jit-validity-period <period>
----
If you don't specify a SVM, the command modifies the global JIT settings. The following example will set the default JIT session duration to 45 minutes and the maximum JIT duration to 30-days for SVM `svm1`: +
`security jit-privilege modify -vserver svm1 -default-session-validity-period 45m -max-jit-validity-period 30d`
+
In this example, users will be able to access JIT elevation for 45 minutes at a time and can initiate JIT sessions for a maximum of 30-days after their configured start date.

== Configure JIT privilege elevation access for a user
You can assign JIT privilege elevation access to ONTAP users. 

.Steps

. Check the current JIT access for a user:
+
[source, cli]
----
security jit-privilege user show -username <username>
----
`-username` is optional. If you don't specify a username, the command shows the JIT access for all users.

. Assign new JIT access for a user:
+
[source, cli]
----
security jit-privilege create -username <username> -vserver <svm_name> -role <rbac_role> -session-validity-period <period> -jit-validity-period <period> -start-time <date>
----
* If `-vserver` is not specified, JIT access is assigned at the cluster level.
* `-role` is the RBAC role that the user will be elevated to. If not specified, defaults to `admin`.
* `-session-validity-period` is the duration for which the user can access the elevated role before needing to start a new JIT session. If not specified, the global or SVM `default-session-validity-period` is used.
* `-jit-validity-period` is the maximum duration for which a user can initiate JIT sessions after the configured start date. If not specified, the `session-validity-period` is used. This parameter cannot exceed the global or SVM `max-jit-validity-period`.
* `-start-time` is the date and time after which the user can initiate JIT sessions. If not specified, the current date and time is used.
+
The following example will allow `ontap_user` to access the `admin` role for 1 hour before needing to start a new JIT session. `ontap_user` will be able to initiate JIT sessions for a 60 day period starting at 1PM on July 1, 2025: +
`security jit-privilege user create -username ontap_user -role admin -session-validity-period 1h -jit-validity-period 60d -start-time "7/1/25 13:00:00"`

. If needed, revoke a user's JIT access:
+
[source, cli]
----
security jit-privilege user delete -username <username> -vserver <svm_name>
----
This command will revoke a user's JIT access, even if their access has not expired. If `-vserver` is not specified, the JIT access is revoked at the cluster level. If the user is in an active JIT session, the session will be terminated.
