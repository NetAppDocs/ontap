You can enable login accounts for ONTAP cluster administrators and storage virtual machine (SVM) administrators. You can also use role-based access control (RBAC) to define the capabilities of administrators.

You can enable local administrator accounts to access an admin storage virtual machine (SVM) or a data SVM with the following types of authentication:

* link:enable-password-account-access-task.html[Password]
* link:enable-ssh-public-key-accounts-task.html[SSH public key]
* link:enable-ssl-certificate-accounts-task.html[SSL certificate]
* link:mfa-overview.html[SSH multifactor authentication (MFA)]
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.3, authentication with password and public key is supported.

You can enable remote administrator accounts to access an admin SVM or a data SVM with the following types of authentication:

* link:rant-access-active-directory-users-groups-task.html[Active Directory]
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.1, you can use an SSH public key as either your primary or secondary authentication method for an Active Directory user.

* link:..system-admin/configure-saml-authentication-task.html[SAML authentication (only for admin SVM)]
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.3, Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication can be used for accessing the admin SVM by using any of the following web services: Service Processor Infrastructure, ONTAP APIs, or System Manager.

* link:grant-access-nis-ldap-user-accounts-task.html[LDAP or NIS]
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.4, SSH MFA can be used for remote users on LDAP or NIS servers. Authentication with nsswitch and public key is supported.
