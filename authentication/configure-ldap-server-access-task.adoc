You must configure LDAP server access to an SVM before LDAP accounts can access the SVM. You can use the `vserver services name-service ldap client create` command to create an LDAP client configuration on the SVM. You can then use the `vserver services name-service ldap create` command to associate the LDAP client configuration with the SVM.

.What you'll need

* You must have installed a link:install-ca-signed-server-digital-certificate-task.html[CA-signed server digital certificate] on the SVM.
* You must be a cluster or SVM administrator to perform this task.

.About this task

Most LDAP servers can use the default schemas provided by ONTAP:

* MS-AD-BIS (the preferred schema for most Windows 2012 and later AD servers)
* AD-IDMU (Windows 2008, Windows 2012 and later AD servers)
* AD-SFU (Windows 2003 and earlier AD servers)
* RFC-2307 (UNIX LDAP servers)

It is best to use the default schemas unless there is a requirement to do otherwise. If so, you can create your own schema by copying a default schema and modifying the copy. For more information, see the following documents.

* link:../nfs-config/index.html[NFS configuration]
* https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/19423-tr-4835.pdf[NetApp Technical Report 4835: How to Configure LDAP in ONTAP^]

.Steps

. Create an LDAP client configuration on an SVM: `vserver services name-service ldap client create -vserver SVM_name -client-config client_configuration -servers LDAP_server_IPs -schema schema -use-start-tls true|false`
+
[NOTE]
====
Start TLS is supported for access to data SVMs only. It is not supported for access to admin SVMs.
====
+
For complete command syntax, see the link:config-worksheets-reference.html[worksheet].
+
The following command creates an LDAP client configuration named `corp` on the SVM``engData``. The client makes anonymous binds to the LDAP servers with the IP addresses `172.160.0.100` and `172.16.0.101`. The client uses the `RFC-2307` schema to make LDAP queries. Communication between the client and server is encrypted using Start TLS.
+
----
cluster1::>vserver services name-service ldap client create
-vserver engData -client-config corp -servers 172.16.0.100,172.16.0.101 -schema RFC-2307 -use-start-tls true
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Beginning with ONTAP 9.2, the field `-ldap-servers` replaces the field `-servers`. This new field can take either a hostname or an IP address for the LDAP server.
====

. Associate the LDAP client configuration with the SVM: `vserver services name-service ldap create -vserver SVM_name -client-config client_configuration -client-enabled true|false`
+
For complete command syntax, see the link:config-worksheets-reference.html[worksheet].
+
The following command associates the LDAP client configuration `corp` with the SVM``engData``, and enables the LDAP client on the SVM.
+
----
cluster1::>vserver services name-service ldap create -vserver engData -client-config corp -client-enabled true
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Beginning with ONTAP 9.2, the `vserver services name-service ldap create` command performs an automatic configuration validation and reports an error message if ONTAP is unable to contact the name server.
====

. Validate the status of the name servers by using the vserver services name-service ldap check command.
+
The following command validates LDAP servers on the SVM vs0.
+
----
cluster1::> vserver services name-service ldap check -vserver vs0

| Vserver: vs0                                                |
| Client Configuration Name: c1                               |
| LDAP Status: up                                             |
| LDAP Status Details: Successfully connected to LDAP server "10.11.12.13".                                              |
----
+
The name service check command is available beginning with ONTAP 9.2.
