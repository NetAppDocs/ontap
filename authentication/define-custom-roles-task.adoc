[.lead]
You can use the `security login role create` command to define a custom role. You can execute the command as many times as necessary to achieve the exact combination of capabilities that you want to associate with the role.

.About this task

* A role, whether predefined or custom, grants or denies access to ONTAP commands or command directories.
+
A command directory (`volume`, for example) is a group of related commands and command subdirectories. Except as described in this procedure, granting or denying access to a command directory grants or denies access to each command in the directory and its subdirectories.

* Specific command access or subdirectory access overrides parent directory access.
+
If a role is defined with a command directory, and then is defined again with a different access level for a specific command or for a subdirectory of the parent directory, the access level that is specified for the command or subdirectory overrides that of the parent.

[NOTE]
You cannot assign an SVM administrator a role that gives access to a command or command directory that is available only to the `admin` cluster administrator--for example, the `security` command directory.


.Before you begin 

You must be a cluster administrator to perform this task.

.Step

. Define a custom role:
+
`security login role create -vserver SVM_name -role role -cmddirname command_or_directory_name -access access_level -query query`
+
Learn more about `security login role create` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/security-login-role-create.html[ONTAP command reference^].
+
The following commands grant the `vol_role` role full access to the commands in the `volume` command directory and read-only access to the commands in the `volume snapshot` subdirectory.
+
----
cluster1::>security login role create -role vol_role -cmddirname "volume" -access all

cluster1::>security login role create -role vol_role -cmddirname "volume snapshot" -access readonly
----
+
The following commands grant the `SVM_storage` role read-only access to the commands in the `storage` command directory, no access to the commands in the `storage encryption` subdirectory, and full access to the `storage aggregate plex offline` nonintrinsic command.
+
----
cluster1::>security login role create -role SVM_storage -cmddirname "storage" -access readonly

cluster1::>security login role create -role SVM_storage -cmddirname "storage encryption" -access none

cluster1::>security login role create -role SVM_storage -cmddirname "storage aggregate plex offline" -access all
