[.lead]
For SSH public key authentication, you must associate the public key with an administrator account before the account can access the SVM. You can use the `security login publickey create` command to associate a key with an administrator account.

.About this task

If you authenticate an account over SSH with both a password and an SSH public key, the account is authenticated first with the public key.

.Before you begin

* You must have generated the SSH key.
* You must be a cluster or SVM administrator to perform this task.

.Steps

. Associate a public key with an administrator account:
+
`security login publickey create -vserver _SVM_name_ -username _user_name_ -index _index_ -publickey _certificate_ -comment _comment_`
+
For complete command syntax, see the worksheet reference for link:config-worksheets-reference.html[Associating a public key with a user account^].

. Verify the change by viewing the public key:
+
`security login publickey show -vserver _SVM_name_ -username _user_name_ -index _index_`

.Example

The following command associates a public key with the SVM administrator account `svmadmin1` for the SVM `engData1`. The public key is assigned index number 5.

cluster1::> security login publickey create -vserver engData1 -username svmadmin1 -index 5 -publickey
"<key text>"
