[.lead]
Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, user accounts can be configured with multifactor authentication (MFA) using a time-based one-time password (TOTP).  


.Before you begin

* The storage administrator must link:setup-ssh-multifactor-authentication-task.html#enable-mfa-with-totp[enable MFA with TOTP] as a second authentication method for your user account.

* Your primary user account authentication method should be a user password or public SSH key.

* You must configure your TOTP app to work with your smartphone and create your TOTP secret key.
+
TOTP is supported by various authenticator apps such as Google Authenticator.

.Steps

. Log in to your user account with your current authentication method.
+
Your current authentication method should be a user password or an SSH public key.

. Create the TOTP configuration on your account:
+
[source,cli]
----
security login totp create -vserver "<svm_name>" -username "<account_username >"
----

. Verify that the TOTP configuration is enabled on your account:
+
[source,cli]
----
security login totp show -vserver "<svm_name>" -username "<account_username>"
