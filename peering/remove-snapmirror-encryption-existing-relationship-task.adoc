By default, cluster peering encryption is enabled on all peer relationships created in ONTAP 9.6 or later. If you do not want to use encryption for cross-cluster peering communications, you can disable it.

.Steps

. On the destination cluster, modify communications with the source cluster to discontinue use of cluster peering encryption:
** To remove encryption, but maintain authentication enter:
.. Modify the cluster peering policy to allow unauthenticated access: 
+
[source,cli]
----
cluster peer policy modify -is-unauthenticated-access-permitted true
----
.. Modify encryption and authentication access:
+
[source,cli]
----
cluster peer modify <source_cluster> -auth-status-admin use-authentication -encryption-protocol-proposed none
----
** To remove encryption and authentication, enter:
+
[source,cli]
----
cluster peer modify <source_cluster> -auth-status no-authentication
----
. When prompted enter the passphrase.
. Confirm the passphrase by re-entering it.

. On the source cluster, disable encryption for communication with the destination cluster:
** To remove encryption, but maintain authentication enter:
+
[source,cli]
----
cluster peer modify <destination_cluster> -auth-status-admin use-authentication -encryption-protocol-proposed none
----
** To remove encryption and authentication:
.. Modify the cluster peering policy to allow unauthenticated access: 
+
[source,cli]
----
cluster peer policy modify -is-unauthenticated-access-permitted true
----
.. Modify encryption and authentication access:
+
[source,cli]
----
cluster peer modify <destination_cluster> -auth-status no-authentication
----
. When prompted, enter and re-enter the same passphrase you used on the destination cluster.
