[.lead]
Before you can protect your data by replicating it to a remote cluster for data backup and disaster recovery purposes, you should create a cluster peer relationship between the local and remote cluster.

Several default protection policies are available. You must have created your protection policies if you want to use custom policies.

// image:workflow_dp_prepare_mirror.gif[workflow diagram of task to prepare for mirroring and vaulting]


.Before you begin

* You must have created link:configure-intercluster-lifs-share-data-ports-task.html[intercluster LIFs] on every node in the clusters being peered.
* The clusters must be running ONTAP 9.3 or later. (If the clusters are running ONTAP 9.2 or earlier, refer to the procedures in link:https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2494079[this archived document^].)

.Steps
Perform this task using ONTAP System Manager or the ONTAP CLI.

[role="tabbed-block"]
====
.System Manager

--

. In the local cluster, click *Cluster > Settings*.
. In the *Intercluster Settings* section, click *Add Network Interfaces* and add intercluster network interfaces for the cluster.
+
Repeat this step on the remote cluster.

. In the remote cluster, click *Cluster > Settings*. 

. Click image:icon_kabob.gif[menu options icon] in the *Cluster Peers* section and select *Generate Passphrase*.

. Select the remote ONTAP cluster version.

. Copy the generated passphrase.

. In the local cluster, under *Cluster peers*, click image:icon_kabob.gif[menu options icon] and select *Peer cluster*.

. In the *Peer cluster* window, paste the passphrase and click *Initiate cluster peering*.

.CLI
--

. On the destination cluster, create a peer relationship with the source cluster:
+
[source,cli]
----
cluster peer create -generate-passphrase -offer-expiration <MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS|1...7days|1...168hours> -peer-addrs <peer_LIF_IPs> -initial-allowed-vserver-peers <svm_name|*> -ipspace <ipspace>
----
+
If you specify both `-generate-passphrase` and `-peer-addrs`, only the cluster whose intercluster LIFs are specified in `-peer-addrs` can use the generated password.
+
You can ignore the `-ipspace` option if you are not using a custom IPspace. For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
If you are creating the peering relationship in ONTAP 9.6 or later and you do not want cross-cluster peering communications to be encrypted, you must use the `-encryption-protocol-proposed none` option to disable encryption.
+
The following example creates a cluster peer relationship with an unspecified remote cluster, and pre-authorizes peer relationships with SVMs `vs1` and `vs2` on the local cluster:
+
----
cluster02::> cluster peer create -generate-passphrase -offer-expiration 2days -initial-allowed-vserver-peers vs1,vs2

                     Passphrase: UCa+6lRVICXeL/gq1WrK7ShR
                Expiration Time: 6/7/2017 08:16:10 EST
  Initial Allowed Vserver Peers: vs1,vs2
            Intercluster LIF IP: 192.140.112.101
              Peer Cluster Name: Clus_7ShR (temporary generated)

Warning: make a note of the passphrase - it cannot be displayed again.
----
+
The following example creates a cluster peer relationship with the remote cluster at intercluster LIF IP addresses 192.140.112.103 and 192.140.112.104, and pre-authorizes a peer relationship with any SVM on the local cluster:
+
----
cluster02::> cluster peer create -generate-passphrase -peer-addrs 192.140.112.103,192.140.112.104 -offer-expiration 2days -initial-allowed-vserver-peers *

                     Passphrase: UCa+6lRVICXeL/gq1WrK7ShR
                Expiration Time: 6/7/2017 08:16:10 EST
  Initial Allowed Vserver Peers: vs1,vs2
            Intercluster LIF IP: 192.140.112.101,192.140.112.102
              Peer Cluster Name: Clus_7ShR (temporary generated)

Warning: make a note of the passphrase - it cannot be displayed again.

. On source cluster, authenticate the source cluster to the destination cluster:
+
[source,cli]
----
cluster peer create -peer-addrs <peer_LIF_IPs> -ipspace <ipspace>
----
+
For complete command syntax, see the man page.
+
The following example authenticates the local cluster to the remote cluster at intercluster LIF IP addresses 192.140.112.101 and 192.140.112.102:
+
----
cluster01::> cluster peer create -peer-addrs 192.140.112.101,192.140.112.102

Notice: Use a generated passphrase or choose a passphrase of 8 or more characters.
        To ensure the authenticity of the peering relationship, use a phrase or sequence of characters that would be hard to guess.

Enter the passphrase:
Confirm the passphrase:

Clusters cluster02 and cluster01 are peered.
----
+
Enter the passphrase for the peer relationship when prompted.

. Verify that the cluster peer relationship was created:
+
[source,cli]
----
cluster peer show -instance
----
+
----
cluster01::> cluster peer show -instance

                               Peer Cluster Name: cluster02

                             Remote Cluster Name: cluster2

                                Last Update Time: 02/05 21:05:41
                    IPspace for the Relationship: Default

. Check the connectivity and status of the nodes in the peer relationship:
