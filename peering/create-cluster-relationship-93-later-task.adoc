[.lead]
Before you can protect your data by replicating it to a remote cluster for data backup and disaster recovery purposes, you should create a cluster peer relationship between the local and remote cluster.

.About this task

This procedure applies to FAS, AFF, and current ASA systems. If you have an ASA r2 system (ASA A1K, ASA A70, or ASA A90), follow link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/asa-r2/data-protection/snapshot-replication.html[these steps^] to create set up snapshot replication. ASA r2 systems provide a simplified ONTAP experience specific to SAN-only customers.

Several default protection policies are available. You must have created your protection policies if you want to use custom policies.

.Before you begin

* If you are using the ONTAP CLI, you must have created intercluster LIFs on every node in the clusters being peered using one of the following methods:
+
 ** link:configure-intercluster-lifs-share-data-ports-task.html[Configure intercluster LIFs on shared data ports] 
 ** link:configure-intercluster-lifs-use-dedicated-ports-task.html[Configure intercluster LIFs on dedicated data ports]
 ** link:configure-intercluster-lifs-use-ports-own-networks-task.html[Configure intercluster LIFs in custom IPspaces]

* The clusters must be running ONTAP 9.3 or later. (If the clusters are running ONTAP 9.2 or earlier, refer to the procedures in link:https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2494079[this archived document^].)

.Steps
Perform this task using ONTAP System Manager or the ONTAP CLI.

[role="tabbed-block"]
====
.System Manager

--

. In the local cluster, click *Cluster > Settings*.
. In the *Intercluster Settings* section, click *Add Network Interfaces* and enter the IP address and subnet mask to add intercluster network interfaces for the cluster.
+
Repeat this step on the remote cluster.

. In the remote cluster, click *Cluster > Settings*. 

. Click image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon] in the *Cluster Peers* section and select *Generate Passphrase*.

. Select the remote ONTAP cluster version.

. Copy the generated passphrase.

. In the local cluster, under *Cluster peers*, click image:icon_kabob.gif[Menu options icon] and select *Peer cluster*.

. In the *Peer cluster* window, paste the passphrase and click *Initiate cluster peering*.

.CLI
--

. On the destination cluster, create a peer relationship with the source cluster:
+
[source,cli]
----
cluster peer create -generate-passphrase -offer-expiration <MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS|1...7days|1...168hours> -peer-addrs <peer_LIF_IPs> -initial-allowed-vserver-peers <svm_name|*> -ipspace <ipspace>
----
+
If you specify both `-generate-passphrase` and `-peer-addrs`, only the cluster whose intercluster LIFs are specified in `-peer-addrs` can use the generated password.
+
You can ignore the `-ipspace` option if you are not using a custom IPspace. 
Learn more about `cluster peer create` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/cluster-peer-create.html[ONTAP command reference^].
+
If you are creating the peering relationship in ONTAP 9.6 or later and you do not want cross-cluster peering communications to be encrypted, you must use the `-encryption-protocol-proposed none` option to disable encryption.
+
The following example creates a cluster peer relationship with an unspecified remote cluster, and pre-authorizes peer relationships with SVMs `vs1` and `vs2` on the local cluster:
+
----
cluster02::> cluster peer create -generate-passphrase -offer-expiration 2days -initial-allowed-vserver-peers vs1,vs2

                     Passphrase: UCa+6lRVICXeL/gq1WrK7ShR
                Expiration Time: 6/7/2017 08:16:10 EST
  Initial Allowed Vserver Peers: vs1,vs2
            Intercluster LIF IP: 192.140.112.101
              Peer Cluster Name: Clus_7ShR (temporary generated)

Warning: make a note of the passphrase - it cannot be displayed again.
----
+
The following example creates a cluster peer relationship with the remote cluster at intercluster LIF IP addresses 192.140.112.103 and 192.140.112.104, and pre-authorizes a peer relationship with any SVM on the local cluster:
+
----
cluster02::> cluster peer create -generate-passphrase -peer-addrs 192.140.112.103,192.140.112.104 -offer-expiration 2days -initial-allowed-vserver-peers *

                     Passphrase: UCa+6lRVICXeL/gq1WrK7ShR
                Expiration Time: 6/7/2017 08:16:10 EST
  Initial Allowed Vserver Peers: vs1,vs2
            Intercluster LIF IP: 192.140.112.101,192.140.112.102
              Peer Cluster Name: Clus_7ShR (temporary generated)

Warning: make a note of the passphrase - it cannot be displayed again.

. On source cluster, authenticate the source cluster to the destination cluster:
+
[source,cli]
----
cluster peer create -peer-addrs <peer_LIF_IPs> -ipspace <ipspace>
----
+
Learn more about `cluster peer create` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/cluster-peer-create.html[ONTAP command reference^].
+
The following example authenticates the local cluster to the remote cluster at intercluster LIF IP addresses 192.140.112.101 and 192.140.112.102:
+
----
cluster01::> cluster peer create -peer-addrs 192.140.112.101,192.140.112.102

Notice: Use a generated passphrase or choose a passphrase of 8 or more characters.
        To ensure the authenticity of the peering relationship, use a phrase or sequence of characters that would be hard to guess.

Enter the passphrase:
Confirm the passphrase:

Clusters cluster02 and cluster01 are peered.
----
+
Enter the passphrase for the peer relationship when prompted.

. Verify that the cluster peer relationship was created:
+
[source,cli]
----
cluster peer show -instance
----
+
----
cluster01::> cluster peer show -instance

                               Peer Cluster Name: cluster02
                   Remote Intercluster Addresses: 192.140.112.101, 192.140.112.102
              Availability of the Remote Cluster: Available
                             Remote Cluster Name: cluster2
                             Active IP Addresses: 192.140.112.101, 192.140.112.102
                           Cluster Serial Number: 1-80-123456
                  Address Family of Relationship: ipv4

                                Last Update Time: 02/05 21:05:41
                    IPspace for the Relationship: Default
----

. Check the connectivity and status of the nodes in the peer relationship:
+
[source,cli]
----
cluster peer health show

----
cluster01::> cluster peer health show
Node       cluster-Name                Node-Name
