You can create peer relationships between source and destination clusters and between source and destination storage virtual machines (SVMs). You must create peer relationships between these entities before you can replicate snapshots using SnapMirror.

ONTAP 9.3 offers enhancements that simplify the way you configure peer relationships between clusters and SVMs. The cluster and SVMs peering procedures are available for all ONTAP 9 versions. You should use the appropriate procedure for your version of ONTAP.

You perform the procedures using the command-line interface (CLI), not System Manager or an automated scripting tool.
