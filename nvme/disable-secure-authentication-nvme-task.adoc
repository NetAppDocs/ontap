= Disable in-band authentication over NVMe
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

[.lead]
If you have configured in-band authentication over NVMe using DH-HMAC-CHAP, you can choose to disable it at any time.  

If you are reverting from ONTAP 9.12.1 or later to ONTAP 9.12.0 or earlier, you must disable in-band authentication before you revert.  If in-band authentication using DH-HMAC-CHAP is not disabled, revert will fail.
