[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, by default, ONTAP supports the ability of NVMe/FC hosts to identify virtual machines by a unique identifier and for NVMe/FC hosts to monitor virtual machine resource utilization.  This enhances host-side reporting and troubleshooting.

You can use the bootarg to disable this functionality. See the Knowledge Base article link:https://kb.netapp.com/on-prem/ontap/da/SAN/SAN-KBs/How_to_disable_NVMe_host_virtual_machine_identifier_in_ONTAP[How to disable NVMe host virtual machine identifier in ONTAP^].
