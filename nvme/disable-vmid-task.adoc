:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, by default, ONTAP supports the ability of NVMe/FC hosts to identify virtual machines by a unique identifier and for NVMe/FC hosts to monitor virtual machine resource utilization.  This enhances host-side reporting and troubleshooting.

You can use the bootarg to disable this functionality.

.Step

. Disable the virtual machine identifier:
+
[source,cli]
----
bootargs set fct_sli_appid_off <port>, <port>
----
+
The following example disables the VMID on port 0g and port 0i.
+
----
bootargs set fct_sli_appid_off 0g,0i

fct_sli_appid_off == 0g,0i
