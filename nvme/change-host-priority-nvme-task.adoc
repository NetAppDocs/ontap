[.lead]

Beginning with ONTAP 9.14.1, you can configure your NVMe subsystem to prioritize resource allocation for specific hosts. By default, when a host is added to the subsystem, it is assigned a regular priority. Hosts assigned a high priority are allocated larger I/O queue counts and queue-depths. 

You can use the ONTAP command line interface (CLI) to manually change the default priority from regular to high.  To change the priority assigned to a host, you must remove the host from the subsystem and then add it back.  

.Steps

. Verify that the host priority is set to regular:
+
[source,cli]
----
vserver nvme show-host-priority 
----

. Remove the host from the subsystem:
+
[source,cli]
----
vserver nvme subsystem host remove –vserver <svm_name> -subsystem <subsystem> -host-nqn <host_nqn>
----

. Verify that the host is removed from the subsystem:
+
[source,cli]
----
vserver nvme subsystem host show
----

. Add the host back to the subsystem with high priority:
+
[source,cli]
----
vserver nvme subsystem host add -vserver <SVM_name> -subsystem <subsystem_name> -host-nqn <Host_NQN_:subsystem._subsystem_name> -priority high
