If you already know the performance requirements for the workloads you want to manage with QoS, you can specify the throughput limit when you create the policy group. Otherwise, you can wait until after you monitor the workloads to specify the limit.

To control and monitor, create policy groups with throughput limits or to monitor only, create policy groups without throughput limits. 3. Assign the storage objects to policy groups. 4. Monitor performance by viewing statistics. 5. Adjust policy settings, if necessary.]
