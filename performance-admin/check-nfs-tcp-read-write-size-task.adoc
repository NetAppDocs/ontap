[.lead]
For NFS, you can check whether the TCP maximum transfer size for reads and writes might be causing a performance issue. If you think the size is slowing performance, you can increase it.

.Before you begin

* You must have cluster administrator privileges to perform this task.
* You must use advanced privilege level commands for this task.

.Steps

. Change to the advanced privilege level:
+
`set -privilege advanced`
. Check the TCP maximum transfer size:
+
`vserver nfs show -vserver _vserver_name_ -instance`
. If the TCP maximum transfer size is too small, increase the size:
+
`vserver nfs modify -vserver _vserver_name_ -tcp-max-xfer-size _integer_`
. Return to the administrative privilege level:
+
`set -privilege admin`

.Example

The following example changes the TCP maximum transfer size of `SVM1` to 1048576:

----
cluster1::*> vserver nfs modify -vserver SVM1 -tcp-max-xfer-size 1048576
