[.lead]
You must add a cluster to an Active IQ Unified Manager server to monitor the cluster, view the cluster discovery status, and monitor its performance.

.Before you begin

* You must have the following information:
 ** Host name or cluster-management IP address
+
The host name is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or short name that Unified Manager uses to connect to the cluster. This host name must resolve to the cluster-management IP address.
+
The cluster-management IP address must be the cluster-management LIF of the administrative storage virtual machine (SVM). If you use a node-management LIF, the operation fails.

 ** ONTAP administrator user name and password
 ** Type of protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) that can be configured on the cluster and the port number of the cluster
* You must have the Application Administrator or Storage Administrator role.
* The ONTAP administrator must have the ONTAPI and SSH administrator roles.
* The Unified Manager FQDN must be able to ping ONTAP.
+
You can verify this by using the ONTAP command `ping -node _node_name_ -destination _Unified_Manager_FQDN_`.

.About this task

For a MetroCluster configuration, you must add both the local and remote clusters, and the clusters must be configured correctly.

.Steps

. Click *Configuration* > *Cluster Data Sources*.
. From the Clusters page, click *Add*.
. In the *Add Cluster* dialog box, specify the required values, such as the host name or IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the cluster, user name, password, protocol for communication, and port number.
+
By default, the HTTPS protocol is selected.
+
You can change the cluster-management IP address from IPv6 to IPv4 or from IPv4 to IPv6. The new IP address is reflected in the cluster grid and the cluster configuration page after the next monitoring cycle finishes.

. Click *Add*.
. If HTTPS is selected, perform the following steps:
 .. In the *Authorize Host* dialog box, click *View Certificate* to view the certificate information about the cluster.
 .. Click *Yes*.
+
Unified Manager checks the certificate only when the cluster is initially added, but does not check it for each API call to ONTAP.
+
If the certificate has expired, you cannot add the cluster. You must renew the SSL certificate and then add the cluster.
. *Optional*: View the cluster discovery status:
 .. Review the cluster discovery status from the *Cluster Setup* page.

+
The cluster is added to the Unified Manager database after the default monitoring interval of approximately 15 minutes.
