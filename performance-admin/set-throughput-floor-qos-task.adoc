You can use the `min-throughput` field for a policy group to define a throughput floor for storage object workloads (QoS Min). You can apply the policy group when you create or modify the storage object. Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can specify the throughput floor in IOPS or MBps, or IOPS and MBps.

.Before you begin

* You must be running ONTAP 9.2 or later. Throughput floors are available beginning with ONTAP 9.2.
* You must be a cluster administrator to create a policy group.
* Beginning in ONTAP 9.13.1, you can enforce throughput floors at the SVM level using an xref:adaptive-policy-template-task.html[adaptive policy group template]. You cannot set an adaptive policy group template on an SVM with a QoS policy group. 

.About this task

* Beginning with ONTAP 9.4, you can use a _non-shared_ QoS policy group to specify that the defined throughput floor be applied to each member workload individually. This is the only condition in which a policy group for a throughput floor can be applied to multiple workloads.
+
Set `-is-shared=false` for the `qos policy-group create` command to specify a non-shared policy group.

* Throughput to a workload might fall below the specified floor if there is insufficient performance capacity (headroom) on the node or aggregate.
* A storage object that is subject to a QoS limit must be contained by the SVM to which the policy group belongs. Multiple policy groups can belong to the same SVM.
* It is a QoS best practice to apply a policy group to the same type of storage objects.
* A policy group that defines a throughput floor cannot be applied to an SVM.

.Steps

. Check for adequate performance capacity on the node or aggregate, as described in link:identify-remaining-performance-capacity-task.html[Identifying remaining performance capacity].
. Create a policy group:
+
`qos policy-group create -policy group _policy_group_ -vserver _SVM_ -min-throughput _qos_target_ -is-shared true|false`
+
Learn more about `qos policy-group create` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/qos-policy-group-create.html[ONTAP command reference^].

You can use the `qos policy-group modify` command to adjust throughput floors.
+
The following command creates the shared policy group `pg-vs2` with a minimum throughput of 1,000 IOPS:
+
----
cluster1::> qos policy-group create -policy group pg-vs2 -vserver vs2 -min-throughput 1000iops -is-shared true
----
+
The following command creates the non-shared policy group `pg-vs4` without a throughput limit:
+
----
cluster1::> qos policy-group create -policy group pg-vs4 -vserver vs4 -is-shared false
----

. Apply a policy group to a volume or LUN:
+
`_storage_object_ create -vserver _SVM_ -qos-policy-group _policy_group_`
+
Learn more about the commands described in this procedure in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/[ONTAP command reference^].
You can use the `_storage_object_modify` command to apply a different policy group to the storage object.
+
The following command applies policy group `pg-app2` to the volume `app2`:
+
----
cluster1::> volume create -vserver vs2 -volume app2 -aggregate aggr1 -qos-policy-group pg-app2
----

. Monitor policy group performance:
+
`qos statistics performance show`
+
Learn more about `qos statistics performance show` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/qos-statistics-performance-show.html[ONTAP command reference^].
+
[NOTE]
====
Monitor performance from the cluster. Do not use a tool on the host to monitor performance.

+
The following command shows policy group performance:
+
----
cluster1::> qos statistics performance show

-total-                 12316       47.76MB/s  1264.00us

. Monitor workload performance:
+
`qos statistics workload performance show`
