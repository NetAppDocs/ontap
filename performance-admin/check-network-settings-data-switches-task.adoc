Although you must maintain the same MTU settings on your clients, servers and storage systems (that is, network endpoints), intermediate network devices such as NICs and switches should be set to their maximum MTU values to ensure that performance is not impacted.

For best performance, all components in the network must be able to forward jumbo frames (9000 bytes IP, 9022 bytes including Ethernet). Data switches should be set to at least 9022 bytes, but a typical value of 9216 is possible with most switches.

.Steps

. For data switches, check that the MTU size is set to 9022 or higher.


For more information, see the switch vendor documentation.
