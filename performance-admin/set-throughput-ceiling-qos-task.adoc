[.lead]
You can use the `max-throughput` field for a policy group to define a throughput ceiling for storage object workloads (QoS Max). You can apply the policy group when you create or modify the storage object.

.What you'll need

* You must be a cluster administrator to create a policy group.
* You must be a cluster administrator to apply a policy group to an SVM.

.About this task

* Beginning with ONTAP 9.4, you can use a _non-shared_ QoS policy group to specify that the defined throughput ceiling applies to each member workload individually. Otherwise, the policy group is _shared:_ the total throughput for the workloads assigned to the policy group cannot exceed the specified ceiling.
+
Set `-is-shared=false` for the `qos policy-group create` command to specify a non-shared policygroup.

* You can specify the throughput limit for the ceiling in IOPS, MB/s, or IOPS, MB/s. If you specify both IOPS and MB/s, whichever limit is reached first is enforced.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you set a ceiling and a floor for the same workload, you can specify the throughput limit for the ceiling in IOPS only.
====

* A storage object that is subject to a QoS limit must be contained by the SVM to which the policy group belongs. Multiple policy groups can belong to the same SVM.
* You cannot assign a storage object to a policy group if its containing object or its child objects belong to the policy group.
* It is a QoS best practice to apply a policy group to the same type of storage objects.

.Steps

. Create a policy group:
+
`qos policy-group create -policy-group _policy_group_ -vserver _SVM_ -max-throughput _number_of_iops_|Mb/S|iops,Mb/S -is-shared true|false`
+
Learn more about `qos policy-group create` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/qos-policy-group-create.html[ONTAP command reference^].
You can use the `qos policy-group modify` command to adjust throughput ceilings.
+
The following command creates the shared policy group `pg-vs1` with a maximum throughput of 5,000 IOPS:
+
----
cluster1::> qos policy-group create -policy-group pg-vs1 -vserver vs1 -max-throughput 5000iops -is-shared true
----
+
The following command creates the non-shared policy group `pg-vs3` with a maximum throughput of 100 IOPS and 400 Kb/S:
+
----
cluster1::> qos policy-group create -policy-group pg-vs3 -vserver vs3 -max-throughput 100iops,400KB/s -is-shared false
----
+
The following command creates the non-shared policy group `pg-vs4` without a throughput limit:
+
----
cluster1::> qos policy-group create -policy-group pg-vs4 -vserver vs4 -is-shared false
----

. Apply a policy group to an SVM, file, volume, or LUN:
+
`_storage_object_ create -vserver _SVM_ -qos-policy-group _policy_group_`
+
Learn more about the commands described in this procedure in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/[ONTAP command reference^].
You can use the `_storage_object_ modify` command to apply a different policy group to the storage object.
+
The following command applies policy group `pg-vs1` to SVM `vs1`:
+
----
cluster1::> vserver create -vserver vs1 -qos-policy-group pg-vs1
----
+
The following commands apply policy group `pg-app` to the volumes `app1` and `app2`:
+
----
cluster1::> volume create -vserver vs2 -volume app1 -aggregate aggr1 -qos-policy-group pg-app
----
+
----
cluster1::> volume create -vserver vs2 -volume app2 -aggregate aggr1 -qos-policy-group pg-app
----

. Monitor policy group performance:
+
`qos statistics performance show`
+

[NOTE]
====
Monitor performance from the cluster. Do not use a tool on the host to monitor performance.

The following command shows policy group performance:

----
cluster1::> qos statistics performance show

. Monitor workload performance:

`qos statistics workload performance show`
