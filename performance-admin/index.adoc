[.lead]
You can set up basic performance monitoring and management tasks and identify and resolve common performance issues.

You can use these procedures to monitor and manage cluster performance if the following assumptions apply to your situation:

* You want to use best practices, not explore every available option.
* You want to display system status and alerts, monitor cluster performance, and perform root-cause analysis by using Active IQ Unified Manager (formerly OnCommand Unified Manager), in addition to the ONTAP command-line interface.
* You are using the ONTAP command-line interface to configure storage quality of service (QoS).
+
QoS is also available in System Manager, NSLM, WFA, VSC (VMware Plug-in), and APIs.

* You want to install Unified Manager by using a virtual appliance, instead of a Linux or Windows-based installation.
* You're willing to use a static configuration rather than DHCP to install the software.
* You can access ONTAP commands at the advanced privilege level.
* You are a cluster administrator with the "admin" role.
