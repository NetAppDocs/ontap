Identifying performance trends can assist you in identifying whether the cluster is being overused or underused by analyzing volume latency. You can use similar steps to identify CPU, network, or other system bottlenecks.

.Steps

. Locate the volume that you suspect is being underused or overused.
. On the *Volume Details* tab, click *30 d* to display the historical data.
. In the "Break down data by" drop-down menu, select *Latency*, and then click *Submit*.
. Deselect *Aggregate* in the cluster components comparison chart, and then compare the cluster latency with the volume latency chart.
. Select *Aggregate* and deselect all other components in the cluster components comparison chart, and then compare the aggregate latency with the volume latency chart.
. Compare the reads/writes latency chart to the volume latency chart.
. Determine whether client application loads have caused a workload contention and rebalance workloads as needed.
. Determine whether the aggregate is overused and causing contention and rebalance workloads as needed.
