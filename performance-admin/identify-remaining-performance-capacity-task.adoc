[.lead]
Performance capacity, or _headroom_, measures how much work you can place on a node or an aggregate before performance of workloads on the resource begins to be affected by latency. Knowing the available performance capacity on the cluster helps you provision and balance workloads.

.Before you begin

Advanced privilege level commands are required for this task.

.About this task

You can use the following values for the `-object` option to collect and display headroom statistics:

* For CPUs, `resource_headroom_cpu`.
* For aggregates, `resource_headroom_aggr`.

You can also complete this task using System Manager and Active IQ Unified Manager.

.Steps

. Change to advanced privilege level:
+
`set -privilege advanced`
. Start real-time headroom statistics collection:
+
`statistics start â€“object resource_headroom_cpu|aggr`
+
Learn more about `statistics start` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/statistics-start.html[ONTAP command reference^].

. Display real-time headroom statistics information:
+
`statistics show -object resource_headroom_cpu|aggr`

. Return to administrative privilege:
+
`set -privilege admin`

.Example

The following example displays the average hourly headroom statistics for cluster nodes.

You can compute the available performance capacity for a node by subtracting the `current_utilization` counter from the `optimal_point_utilization` counter. In this example, the utilization capacity for `CPU_sti2520-213` is -14% (72%-86%), which suggests that the CPU has been overutilized on average for the past hour.

You could have specified `ewma_daily`, `ewma_weekly`, or `ewma_monthly` to get the same information averaged over longer periods of time.
