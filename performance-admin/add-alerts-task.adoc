You can configure alerts to notify you when a particular event is generated. You can configure alerts for a single resource, for a group of resources, or for events of a particular severity type. You can specify the frequency with which you want to be notified and associate a script to the alert.

.Before you begin

* You must have configured notification settings such as the user email address, SMTP server, and SNMP trap host to enable the Active IQ Unified Manager server to use these settings to send notifications to users when an event is generated.
* You must know the resources and events for which you want to trigger the alert, and the user names or email addresses of the users that you want to notify.
* If you want to have a script execute based on the event, you must have added the script to Unified Manager by using the Scripts page.
* You must have the Application Administrator or Storage Administrator role.

.About this task

You can create an alert directly from the Event details page after receiving an event in addition to creating an alert from the Alert Setup page, as described here.

.Steps

. In the left navigation pane, click *Storage Management* > *Alert Setup*.
. In the *Alert Setup* page, click *Add*.
. In the *Add Alert* dialog box, click *Name*, and enter a name and description for the alert.
. Click *Resources*, and select the resources to be included in or excluded from the alert.
+
You can set a filter by specifying a text string in the *Name contains* field to select a group of resources. Based on the text string that you specify, the list of available resources displays only those resources that match the filter rule. The text string that you specify is case-sensitive.
+
If a resource conforms to both the include and exclude rules that you have specified, the exclude rule takes precedence over the include rule, and the alert is not generated for events related to the excluded resource.

. Click *Events*, and select the events based on the event name or event severity type for which you want to trigger an alert.
+
[TIP]
====
To select more than one event, press the Ctrl key while you make your selections.
====

. Click *Actions*, and select the users that you want to notify, choose the notification frequency, choose whether an SNMP trap will be sent to the trap receiver, and assign a script to be executed when an alert is generated.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you modify the email address that is specified for the user and reopen the alert for editing, the Name field appears blank because the modified email address is no longer mapped to the user that was previously selected. Also, if you modified the email address of the selected user from the Users page, the modified email address is not updated for the selected user.
====
+
You can also choose to notify users through SNMP traps.

. Click *Save*.

.Example of adding an alert

This example shows how to create an alert that meets the following requirements:

* Alert name: HealthTest
* Resources: includes all volumes whose name contains "abc" and excludes all volumes whose name contains "xyz"
* Events: includes all critical health events
* Actions: includes "sample@domain.com", a "Test" script, and the user has to be notified every 15 minutes

Perform the following steps in the Add Alert dialog box:

. Click *Name*, and enter `HealthTest` in the *Alert Name* field.
. Click *Resources*, and in the Include tab, select *Volumes* from the drop-down list.
 .. Enter `abc` in the *Name contains* field to display the volumes whose name contains "abc".
 .. Select *+<<All Volumes whose name contains 'abc'>>+* from the Available Resources area, and move it to the Selected Resources area.
 .. Click *Exclude*, and enter `xyz` in the *Name contains* field, and then click *Add*.
. Click *Events*, and select *Critical* from the Event Severity field.
. Select *All Critical Events* from the Matching Events area, and move it to the Selected Events area.
. Click *Actions*, and enter `sample@domain.com` in the Alert these users field.
. Select *Remind every 15 minutes* to notify the user every 15 minutes.
+
You can configure an alert to repeatedly send notifications to the recipients for a specified time. You should determine the time from which the event notification is active for the alert.

. In the Select Script to Execute menu, select *Test* script.
. Click *Save*.
