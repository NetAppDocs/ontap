Before enabling multi-admin verification (MAV), you must create an admin approval group containing one or more administrators to be granted approve or veto authority. Once you have enabled multi-admin verification, any modifications to approval group membership requires approval from one of the existing qualified administrators.

.About this task

You can add existing administrators to a MAV group or create new administrators.

MAV functionality honors existing role-based access control (RBAC) settings. Potential MAV administrators must have sufficient privilege to execute protected operations before they are added to MAV administrator groups. link:../authentication/create-svm-user-accounts-task.html[Learn more about RBAC.]

You can configure MAV to alert MAV administrators that approval requests are pending. To do so, you must configure email notifications--in particular, the `Mail From` and `Mail Server` parameters--or you can clear these parameters to disable notification. Without email alerts, MAV administrators must check the approval queue manually.

== System Manager procedure

If you want to create a MAV approval group for the first time, see the System Manager procedure to link:enable-disable-task.html#system-manager-procedure[enable multi-admin verification.]

To modify an existing approval group or create an additional approval group:

. Identify administrators to receive multi-admin verification.
.. Click *Cluster > Settings.*
.. Click image:icon_arrow.gif[Arrow icon] next to *Users and Roles.*
.. Click image:icon_add.gif[Add icon] under *Users.*
.. Modify the roster as needed.
+
For more information, see link:../task_security_administrator_access.html[Control administrator access.]
+
.	Create or modify the MAV approval group:
.. Click *Cluster > Settings.*
.. Click image:icon_arrow.gif[Arrow icon] next to *Multi-Admin Approval* in the *Security* section.
(You will see the image:icon_gear.gif[Actions icon] icon if MAV is not yet configured.)

* Name: enter a group name.
* Approvers: select approvers from a list of users.
* Email address: enter email address(es).
* Default group: select a group.

MAV approval is required to edit an existing configuration once MAV is enabled.

== CLI procedure

. Verify that values have been set for the `Mail From` and `Mail Server` parameters. Enter:
+
`event config show`
+
The display should be similar to the following:
+
----
cluster01::> event config show
                           Mail From:  admin@localhost
                         Mail Server:  localhost
                           Proxy URL:  -
                          Proxy User:  -
 Publish/Subscribe Messaging Enabled:  true
----
+
To configure these parameters, enter:
+
`event config modify -mail-from _email_address_ -mail-server _server_name_`

. Identify administrators to receive multi-admin verification

| If you want to…
| Enter this command
| Display current administrators a| `security login show`
| Modify credentials of current administrators a| `security login modify _<parameters>_`
| Create new administrator accounts a| `security login create -user-or-group-name _admin_name_ -application ssh -authentication-method password`

|===

.	Create the MAV approval group: 
+
`security multi-admin-verify approval-group create [ -vserver _svm_name_] -name _group_name_ -approvers _approver1_[,_approver2_…] [[-email _address1_], _address1_...]`
+
* `-vserver` - Only the admin SVM is supported in this release.
* `-name` - The MAV group name, up to 64 characters.
* `-approvers` - The list of one or more approvers.
* `-email` - One or more email addresses that are notified when a request is created, approved, vetoed, or executed.
+
*Example:* The following command creates a MAV group with two members and associated email addresses.
+
----
cluster-1::> security multi-admin-verify approval-group create -name mav-grp1 -approvers pavan,julia -email pavan@myfirm.com,julia@myfirm.com
----

.	Verify group creation and membership:
+
`security multi-admin-verify approval-group show`
+
*Example:*
+
----
cluster-1::> security multi-admin-verify approval-group show
Vserver  Name        Approvers        Email
-------  ---------------- ------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------
svm-1    mav-grp1   pavan,julia      email pavan@myfirm.com,julia@myfirm.com
----

Use these commands to modify your initial MAV group configuration.

*Note:* All require MAV administrator approval before execution.
