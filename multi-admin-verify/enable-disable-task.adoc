Multi-admin verification (MAV) must be enabled explicitly. Once you have enabled multi-admin verification, approval by administrators in a MAV approval group (MAV administrators) is required to delete it.

.About this task

Once MAV is enabled, modifying or disabling MAV requires MAV administrator approval.

NOTE: If you need to disable multi-admin verification functionality without MAV administrator approval, contact NetApp Support and mention the following link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Storage_Software/ONTAP_OS/How_to_disable_Multi-Admin_Verification_if_MAV_admin_is_unavailable[NetApp Knowledge Base: How to disable Multi-Admin Verification if MAV admin is unavailable^].

When you enable MAV, you can specify the following parameters globally.

Approval groups:: A list of global approval groups. At least one group is required to enable MAV functionality.

TIP: If you are using MAV with Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP), define a new or existing approval group that is responsible for approving ARP pause, disable, and clear suspect requests.

Required approvers:: The number of approvers required to execute a protected operation. The default and minimum number is 1.
+
NOTE: The required number of approvers must be less than the total number of unique approvers in the default approval groups.

Approval expiry (hours, minutes, seconds):: The period within which a MAV administrator must respond to an approval request. The default value is one hour (1h), the minimum supported value is one second (1s), and the maximum supported value is 14 days (14d).

Execution expiry (hours, minutes, seconds):: The period within which the requesting administrator must complete the:: operation. The default value is one hour (1h), the minimum supported value is one second (1s), and the maximum supported value is 14 days (14d).

You can also override any of these parameters for specific link:manage-rules-task.html[operation rules.]

a| If you want to…
a| Enter this command
a| Enable MAV functionality a| `security multi-admin-verify modify -approval-groups _group1_[,_group2_...] [-required-approvers _nn_ ] -enabled true   [ -execution-expiry [__nn__h][__nn__m][__nn__s]]    [ -approval-expiry [__nn__h][__nn__m][__nn__s]]`

*Example* : the following command enables MAV with 1 approval group, 2 required approvers, and default expiry periods.
----
cluster-1::> security multi-admin-verify modify -approval-groups mav-grp1 -required-approvers 2 -enabled true
----

Complete initial configuration by adding at least one link:manage-rules-task.html[operation rule.]

a| Modify a MAV configuration (requires MAV approval) a| `security multi-admin-verify approval-group modify [-approval-groups _group1_[,_group2_...]] [-required-approvers _nn_ ]    [ -execution-expiry [__nn__h][__nn__m][__nn__s]]    [ -approval-expiry [__nn__h][__nn__m][__nn__s]]`

a| Verify MAV functionality a| `security multi-admin-verify show`

*Example:*
....
cluster-1::> security multi-admin-verify show
Is      Required  Execution Approval Approval
Enabled Approvers Expiry    Expiry   Groups
------- --------- --------- -------- ----------
true    2         1h        1h       mav-grp1
