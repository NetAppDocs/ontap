[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, you can use multi-admin verification (MAV) to ensure that certain operations, such as deleting volumes or Snapshot copies, can be executed only after approvals from designated administrators. This prevents compromised, malicious, or inexperienced administrators from making undesirable changes or deleting data.

Configuring multi-admin verification consists of:

*  link:manage-groups-task.html[Creating one or more administrator approval groups.]
*  link:enable-disable-task.html[Enabling multi-admin verification functionality.]
*  link:manage-rules-task.html[Adding or modifying rules.]

After initial configuration, these elements can be modified only by administrators in a MAV approval group (MAV administrators).

When multi-admin verification is enabled, the completion of every protected operation requires these steps:

. When a user initiates the operation, a link:request-operation-task.html[request is generated.]
. Before it can be executed, at least one link:manage-requests-task.html[MAV administrator must approve.]
. Upon approval, the user completes the operation.

NOTE: If you need to disable multi-admin verification functionality without MAV administrator approval, contact NetApp Support and mention the following Knowledge Base article: https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Storage_Software/ONTAP_OS/How_to_disable_Multi-Admin_Verification_if_MAV_admin_is_unavailable[How to disable Multi-Admin Verification if MAV admin is unavailable^].

Multi-admin verification is not intended for use with volumes or workflows that involve heavy automation, because each automated task would require approval before the operation could be completed.  If you want to use automation and MAV together, it's recommended to use queries for specific MAV operations. For example, you could apply `volume delete` MAV rules only to volumes where automation is not involved, and you could designate those volumes with a particular naming scheme.

NOTE: Multi-admin verification is not available with Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

== How multi-admin verification works

Multi-admin verification consists of:

* A group of one or more administrators with approval and veto powers.
* A set of protected operations or commands in a _rules table_.
* A _rules engine_ to identify and control execution of protected operations.

MAV rules are evaluated after role-based access control (RBAC) rules. Therefore, administrators who execute or approve protected operations must already possess the minimum RBAC privileges for those operations. link:../authentication/manage-access-control-roles-concept.html[Learn more about RBAC].

=== System-defined rules 

When multi-admin verification is enabled, system-defined rules (also known as _guard-rail_ rules) establish a set of MAV operations to contain the risk of circumventing the MAV process itself. These operations cannot be removed from the rules table. Once MAV is enabled, operations designated by an asterisk ( * ) require approval by one or more administrators before execution, except for *show* commands.

* `security multi-admin-verify modify` operation `*`
+
Controls the configuration of multi-admin verification functionality.
* `security multi-admin-verify approval-group` operations `*`

== How multi-admin approval works

Any time a protected operation is entered on a MAV-protected cluster, an operation execution request is sent to the designated MAV administrator group.

You can configure:

* The names, contact information, and number of administrators in the MAV group.
+
A MAV administrator should have an RBAC role with cluster administrator privileges.
* The number of MAV administrator groups.
** A MAV group is assigned for each protected operation rule.
** For multiple MAV groups, you can configure which MAV group approves a given rule.
* The number of MAV approvals required to execute a protected operation.
* An _approval expiry_ period within which a MAV administrator must respond to an approval request.
* An _execution expiry_ period within which the requesting administrator must complete the operation.

Once these parameters are configured, MAV approval is required to modify them.

MAV administrators cannot approve their own requests to execute protected operations. Therefore:

* MAV should not be enabled on clusters with only one administrator.
* If there is only one person in the MAV group, that MAV administrator cannot initiate protected operations; regular administrators must initiate protected operations, and the MAV administrator can only approve. 
* If you want MAV administrators to be able to execute protected operations, the number of MAV administrators must be one greater than the number of approvals required.
For example, if two approvals are required for a protected operation, and you want MAV administrators to execute them, there must be three people in the MAV administrators group.

MAV administrators can receive approval requests in email alerts (using EMS) or they can query the request queue.  When they receive a request, they can take one of three actions:

* Approve
* Reject (veto)
* Ignore (no action)

Email notifications are sent to all approvers associated with a MAV rule when:

* A request is created.
* A request is approved or vetoed.
* An approved request is executed.

If the requestor is in the same approval group for the operation, they will receive an email when their request is approved.

NOTE: A requestor can't approve their own requests even if they are in the approval group. They can get email notifications. Requestors who are not in approval groups (that is, who are not MAV administrators) don't receive email notifications.


== How protected operation execution works

If execution is approved for a protected operation, the requesting user continues with the operation when prompted. If the operation is vetoed, the requesting user must delete the request before proceeding.

MAV rules are evaluated after RBAC permissions. As a result, a user without sufficient RBAC permissions for operation execution cannot initiate the MAV request process.
