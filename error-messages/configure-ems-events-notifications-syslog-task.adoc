To log notifications of the most severe events on a syslog server, you must configure the EMS to forward notifications for events that signal important activity.

.What you'll need

DNS must be configured on the cluster to resolve the syslog server name.

.About this task

If your environment does not already contain a syslog server for event notifications, you must first create one. If your environment already contains a syslog server for logging events from other systems, then you might want to use that one for important event notifications.

You can perform this task any time the cluster is running by entering the commands on the ONTAP CLI.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, EMS events can be sent to a designated port on a remote syslog server via the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. Two new parameters are available:

`tcp-encrypted`:: 
When `tcp-encrypted` is specified for the `syslog-transport`, ONTAP verifies the identity of the destination host by validating its certificate. The default value is `udp-unencrypted`. 

`syslog-port`::
The default value `syslog-port` parameter depends on the setting for the `syslog-transport` parameter. If `syslog-transport` is set to `tcp-encrypted`, `syslog-port` has the default value 6514.

Learn more about `event notification destination create` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/event-notification-destination-create.html[ONTAP command reference^].

.Steps

. Create a syslog server destination for important events:
+
`event notification destination create -name _syslog-ems_ -syslog _syslog-server-address_ -syslog-transport {udp-unencrypted|tcp-unencrypted|tcp-encrypted}`
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, the following values can be specified for `syslog-transport`:

* `udp-unencrypted` - User Datagram Protocol with no security
* `tcp-unencrypted` - Transmission Control Protocol with no security
* `tcp-encrypted` - Transmission Control Protocol with Transport Layer Security (TLS)

+
The default protocol is `udp-unencrypted``. 
. Configure the important events to forward notifications to the syslog server:
+
`event notification create -filter-name _important-events_ -destinations _syslog-ems_`
