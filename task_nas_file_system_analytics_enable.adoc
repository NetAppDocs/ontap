To collect and display usage data such as capacity analytics, you need to enable File System Analytics on a volume.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, you can enable File System Analytics on a new or existing volume. If you upgrade a system to ONTAP 9.8 or later, ensure that all upgrade processes have completed before you enable File System Analytics.

.About this task

Depending on the size and contents of the volume, enabling analytics may take time while ONTAP processes existing data in the volume. System Manager displays progress and presents analytics data when complete. If you need more precise information about initialization progress, you can use the ONTAP CLI command `volume analytics show`.

For additional considerations related to the initialization scan, see xref:./file-system-analytics/considerations-concept.html#scan-considerations[Scan considerations].

.Steps 

You can enable File System Analytics with ONTAP System Manager or the CLI.

.To enable File System Analytics with the CLI:
. Run the following command:
`volume analytics on -vserver _svm_name_ -volume _volume_name_ [-foreground {true|false}]`
By default, the command runs in the foreground; ONTAP displays progress and presents analytics data when complete. If you need more precise information, you can run the command in the background by using the `-foreground false` option and then use the `volume analytics show` command to display initialization progress in the CLI.
. After successfully enabling File System Analytics, use ONTAP System Manager to display the analytic data.
