An effective security posture adheres to established organizational policies, guidelines, and any governance or standards that apply to the organization. Examples of these requirements include user name lifetime, password-length requirements, character requirements, and the storage of such accounts. The ONTAP solution provides features and functions to address these security constructs.  

== New local account features

To support an organization's user account policies, guidelines, or standards, including governance, the following functionality is supported in ONTAP:

* Configuring password policies to enforce a minimum number of digits, lowercase characters, or uppercase characters
* Requiring a delay after a failed login attempt
* Defining the account inactive limit
* Expiring a user account
* Displaying a password expiration warning message
* Notification of an invalid login

NOTE: Configurable settings are managed by using the security login role config modify command.

== SHA-512 support
To enhance password security, ONTAP 9 supports the SHA-2 password hash function and defaults to using SHA-512 for hashing newly created or changed passwords. Operators and administrators can also expire or lock accounts as needed.

Pre-existing ONTAP 9 user accounts with unchanged passwords continue to use the MD5 hash function after the upgrade to ONTAP 9.0 or later. However, NetApp strongly recommends that these user accounts migrate to the more secure SHA-512 solution by having users change their passwords.

The password hash functionality enables you to perform the following tasks:

* Display user accounts that match the specified hash function:
+
----
cluster1::*> security login show -user-or-group-name NewAdmin -fields  hash-function
vserver  user-or-group-name application authentication-method hash-function 
-------- ------------------ ----------- --------------------- ------------- 
cluster1 NewAdmin           console     password              sha512        
cluster1 NewAdmin           ontapi      password              sha512        
cluster1 NewAdmin           ssh         password              sha512  

----

* Expire accounts that use a specified hash function (for example, MD5), which forces users to change their passwords at the next login:
+
----
cluster1::*> security login expire-password -vserver * -username * -hash-function md5
----

* Lock accounts with passwords that use the specified hash function.
+
----
cluster1::*> security login lock -vserver * -username * -hash-function md5
----
+
The password hash function is unknown for the internal `autosupport` user in your cluster's administrative SVM. This issue is cosmetic. The hash function is unknown because this internal user does not have a configured password by default.

** To view the password hash function for the `autosupport` user, run the following commands:
+
----
::> set advanced
::> security login show -user-or-group-name autosupport -instance

                      Vserver: cluster1
      User Name or Group Name: autosupport
                  Application: console
        Authentication Method: password
     Remote Switch IP Address: -
                    Role Name: autosupport
               Account Locked: no
                 Comment Text: -
      Whether Ns-switch Group: no
       Password Hash Function: unknown
Second Authentication Method2: none
----

** To set the password hash function (default: sha512), run the following command:
+
----
::> security login password -username autosupport
----
+
It does not matter what the password is set to.
+
----
security login show -user-or-group-name autosupport -instance

                      Vserver: cluster1
      User Name or Group Name: autosupport
                  Application: console
        Authentication Method: password
     Remote Switch IP Address: -
                    Role Name: autosupport
               Account Locked: no
                 Comment Text: -
      Whether Ns-switch Group: no
       Password Hash Function: sha512

== Password parameters

The ONTAP solution supports password parameters that address and support organizational policy requirements and guidelines.
