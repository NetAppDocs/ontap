[.lead]
pNFS was introduced to improve upon traditional NFS by separating metadata and data paths, providing data localization, and enabling parallel operations.

== Challenges of traditional NFS and benefits of pNFS

The following table shows the challenges of traditional NFS and explains how pNFS in NetApp ONTAP addresses them.

[cols="40,60"]
|===
| Challenge | pNFS benefit

| Same path for metadata and data
| Metadata and data paths are separate, data paths are parallelized

| Workload distribution challenges
| Local, parallel paths to data structures

| Relocation of NFS mount points
| Automatic path relocation
|===

== Configuration

Configuration of pNFS in NetApp ONTAP requires the following:

* An NFS client that supports pNFS and is mounted with NFSv4.1 or later
* NFSv4.1 enabled on the NFS server in ONTAP (`nfs modify -v4.1 enabled`; off by default)
* pNFS enabled in the NFS server in ONTAP (`nfs modify -v4.1-pnfs enabled`; on by default)
* At least one network interface per node, routable to the NFS clients
* Data volumes in the SVM that have export policies and rules that allow NFSv4

Once the above configuration requirements are met, pNFS will simply work on its own.
