Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, System Manager shows which NFS client connections are active when NFS is licensed on a cluster.

This allows you to quickly verify which NFS clients are actively connect to a storage VM, which are connected but idle, and which are disconnected.

For each NFS client IP address, the *NFS Clients* display shows:
* Time of last access
* Network interface IP address
* NFS connection version
* Storage VM name

In addition, a list of NFS clients active in the last 48 hours is also shown in the *Storage>Volumes* display and a count of NFS clients is includes in the *Dashboard* display.
