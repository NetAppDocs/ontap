Using System Manager, you can monitor how much storage capacity has been used and how much is still available for a cluster or a local tier.  

Also, beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can use System Manager to view historical data about the clusterâ€™s capacity and projections about how much capacity will be used or available in the future. You can also monitor the capacity of local tiers and volumes.  Additionally, beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, System Manager also displays the amount of committed capacity for a local tier.

NOTE: Measurements of used capacity are displayed differently depending on the version of System Manager you are using, as explained in link:../concepts/capacity_measurements_in_sm_concept.html[Capacity measurements in System Manager].

== View the capacity of a cluster

You can view capacity measurements for a cluster on the Dashboard in System Manager.

.Before you begin

To view data related to the capacity in the cloud, you must have an account with Active IQ Digital Advisor and be connected.

.Steps

. In System Manager, click *Dashboard*. 

. In the *Capacity* section, you can view the following:
+
--
* Total used capacity of the cluster
* Total available capacity of the cluster
* Percentages of used and available capacity.
* Ratio of data reduction.
* Amount of capacity used in the cloud.
* History of capacity usage.
* Projection of capacity usage
--
+
NOTE: In System Manager, capacity representations do not account for root storage tier (aggregate) capacities.

. Click image:../media/icon_arrow.gif[right arrow] to view more details about the capacity of the cluster.

== View the capacity of a local tier

You can view details about the capacity of local tiers.  Also, beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1, you can view the amount of committed capacity for a local tier to determine whether you need to add capacity to the local tier to accommodate the committed capacity and avoid running out of free space.

.Steps

. Click *Storage > Tiers*.

. Select the name of the local tier.

. On the *Overview* page, in the *Capacity* section, the capacity is show in a bar chart with three measurements:
+
* Used and reserved capacity

* Available capacity

* Committed capacity (beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1)

. Click the chart to view details about the capacity of the local tier.  
+
Capacity measurements are shown in two bar charts:
+
--
* The top bar chart displays physical capacity: the size of physical used, reserved, and available space.
* The bottom bar chart displays logical capacity:  the size of client data, Snapshot copies, and clones, and the total of logical used space.
--
+
Below the bar charts are measurements ratios for data reduction:
+
--
* Overall data reduction ratio. 
* Data reduction ratio for only the client data (Snapshot copies and clones are not included).
--

.Optional actions

* If the committed capacity is larger than the capacity of the local tier, you might consider adding capacity to the local tier before it runs out of free space.  See link:./disks-aggregates/add-disks-local-tier-aggr-task.html[Add capacity to a local tier (add disks to an aggregate)].

* You can also view the capacity that specific volumes use in the local tier by selecting the *Volumes* tab.
