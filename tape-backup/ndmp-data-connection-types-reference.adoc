In the storage virtual machine (SVM)-scoped NDMP mode, the supported NDMP data connection types depend on the NDMP control connection LIF type and the status of the CAB extension. This NDMP data connection type indicates whether you can perform a local or a three-way NDMP backup or restore operation.

You can perform a three-way NDMP backup or restore operation over a TCP or TCP/IPv6 network. The following tables show the NDMP data connection types based on the NDMP control connection LIF type and the status of the CAB extension.
