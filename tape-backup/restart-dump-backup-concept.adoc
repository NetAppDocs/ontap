A dump backup sometimes does not finish because of internal or external errors, such as tape write errors, power outages, accidental user interruptions, or internal inconsistency on the storage system. If your backup fails for one of these reasons, you can restart it.

You can choose to interrupt and restart a backup to avoid periods of heavy traffic on the storage system or to avoid competition for other limited resources on the storage system, such as a tape drive. You can interrupt a long backup and restart it later if a more urgent restore (or backup) requires the same tape drive. Restartable backups persist across reboots. You can restart an aborted backup to tape only if the following conditions are true:

* The aborted backup is in phase IV.
* All of the associated snapshots that were locked by the dump command are available.
* The file history must be enabled.

When such a dump operation is aborted and left in a restartable state, the associated snapshots are locked. These snapshots are released after the backup context is deleted. You can view the list of backup contexts by using the `vserver services ndmp restartable backup show` command.
