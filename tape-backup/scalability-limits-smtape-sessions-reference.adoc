[.lead]
While performing SMTape backup and restore operations through NDMP or CLI (tape seeding), you must be aware of the maximum number of SMTape backup and restore sessions that can be performed simultaneously on storage systems with different system memory capacities. This maximum number depends on the system memory of a storage system.

[NOTE]
====
SMTape backup and restore sessions scalability limits are different from NDMP session limits and dump session limits.

You can obtain the system memory of your storage system by using the `sysconfig -a` command (available through the nodeshell). 
Learn more about `sysconfig -a` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/system-node-run.html[ONTAP command reference^].
