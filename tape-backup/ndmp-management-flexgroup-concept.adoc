Beginning with ONTAP 9.7, NDMP is supported on FlexGroup volumes.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.7, the ndmpcopy command is supported for data transfer between FlexVol and FlexGroup volumes.

If you revert from ONTAP 9.7 to an earlier version, the incremental transfer information of the previous transfers is not retained and therefore, you must perform a baseline copy after reverting.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.8, the following NDMP features are supported on FlexGroup volumes:

* The NDMP_SNAP_RECOVER message in the extension class 0x2050 can be used for recovering individual files in a FlexGroup volume.
* NDMP restartable backup extension (RBE) is supported for FlexGroup volumes.
* Environment variables EXCLUDE and MULTI_SUBTREE_NAMES are supported for FlexGroup volumes.
