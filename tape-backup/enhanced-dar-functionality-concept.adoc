You can use the enhanced direct access recovery (DAR) functionality for directory DAR and DAR of files and NT streams. By default, enhanced DAR functionality is enabled.

Enabling enhanced DAR functionality might impact the backup performance because an offset map has to be created and written onto tape. You can enable or disable enhanced DAR in both the node-scoped and storage virtual machine (SVM)-scoped NDMP modes.
