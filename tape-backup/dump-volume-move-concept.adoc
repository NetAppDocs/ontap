Tape backup and restore operations and volume move can run in parallel until the final cutover phase is attempted by the storage system. After this phase, new tape backup and restore operations are not allowed on the volume that is being moved. However, the current operations continue to run until completion.

The following table describes the behavior of tape backup and restore operations after the volume move operation:

[options="header"]
|===
| If you are performing tape backup and restore operations in the...| Then...
a|
storage virtual machine (SVM) scoped NDMP mode when CAB extension is supported by the backup application
a|
You can continue performing incremental tape backup and restore operations on read/write and read-only volumes without reconfiguring backup policies.
a|
SVM-scoped NDMP mode when CAB extension is not supported by the backup application
a|
You can continue performing incremental tape backup and restore operations on read/write and read-only volumes if you migrate the LIF configured in the backup policy to the node that hosts the destination aggregate. Otherwise, after the volume move, you must perform a baseline backup before performing the incremental backup operation.

//Node-scoped NDMP mode

[NOTE]
====
When a volume move occurs, if the volume belonging to a different SVM on the destination node has the same name as that of the moved volume, then you cannot perform incremental backup operations of the moved volume.
