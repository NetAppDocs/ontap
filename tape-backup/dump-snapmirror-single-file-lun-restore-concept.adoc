Before you perform dump backup or restore operations on a volume to which a single file or LUN is restored by using SnapMirror technology, you must understand how dump operations work with a single file or LUN restore operation.

During a SnapMirror single file or LUN restore operation, client I/O is restricted on the file or LUN being restored. When the single file or LUN restore operation finishes, the I/O restriction on the file or LUN is removed. If a dump backup is performed on a volume to which a single file or LUN is restored, then the file or LUN that has client I/O restriction is not included in the dump backup. In a subsequent backup operation, this file or LUN is backed up to tape after the I/O restriction is removed.

You cannot perform a dump restore and a SnapMirror single file or LUN restore operation simultaneously on the same volume.
