You must be aware of the maximum number of NDMP sessions that can be established simultaneously on storage systems of different system memory capacities. This maximum number depends on the system memory of a storage system.

The limits mentioned in the following table are for the NDMP server. The limits mentioned in the section "`Scalability limits for dump backup and restore sessions`" are for the dump and restore session.
