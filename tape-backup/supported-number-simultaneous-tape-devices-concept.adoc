[.lead]
ONTAP supports a maximum of 64 simultaneous tape drive connections, 16 medium changers, and 16 bridge or router devices for each storage system (per node) in any mix of Fibre Channel, SCSI, or SAS attachments.

Tape drives or medium changers can be devices in physical or virtual tape libraries or stand-alone devices.

[NOTE]
====
Although a storage system can detect 64 tape drive connections, the maximum number of backup and restore sessions that can be performed simultaneously depends upon the scalability limits of the backup engine.
