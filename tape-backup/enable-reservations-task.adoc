You can control how ONTAP manages tape device reservations by using the `tape.reservations` option. By default, tape reservation is turned off.

.About this task

Enabling the tape reservations option can cause problems if tape drives, medium changers, bridges, or libraries do not work properly. If tape commands report that the device is reserved when no other storage systems are using the device, this option should be disabled.

.Steps

. To use either the SCSI Reserve/Release mechanism or SCSI Persistent Reservationsor to disable tape reservations, enter the following commandat the clustershell:
+
`*options -option-name tape.reservations -option-value {scsi | persistent | off}*`
+
`scsi` selects the SCSI Reserve/Release mechanism.
+
`persistent` selects SCSI Persistent Reservations.
+
`off` disables tape reservations.
