[.lead]
You can perform tape backup operations on data that is mirrored on the SnapVault secondary volume. You can back up only the data that is mirrored on the SnapVault secondary volume to tape, and not the SnapVault relationship metadata.

When you break the data protection mirror relationship (`snapmirror break`) or when a SnapMirror resynchronization occurs, you must always perform a baseline backup.
