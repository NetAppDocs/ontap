[.lead]
In the node-scoped NDMP mode, you must use NDMP specific credentials to access a storage system in order to perform tape backup and restore operations.

The default user ID is "`root`". Before using NDMP on a node, you must ensure that you change the default NDMP password associated with the NDMP user. You can also change the default NDMP user ID.
