Creating multiple copies of regulated data provides you with redundant recovery scenarios, and by using NDMP dump and restore, it's possible to preserve the write once, read many (WORM) characteristics of source files on a SnapLock volume.

WORM attributes on the files in a SnapLock volume are preserved when backing up, restoring and copying data; however, WORM attributes are enforced only when restoring to a SnapLock volume. If a backup from a SnapLock volume is restored to a volume other than a SnapLock volume, the WORM attributes are preserved but are ignored and are not enforced by ONTAP.
