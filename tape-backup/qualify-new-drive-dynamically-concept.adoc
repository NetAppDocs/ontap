The storage system qualifies a tape drive dynamically by matching its vendor ID and product ID with the information contained in the tape qualification table.

When you connect a tape drive to the storage system, it looks for a vendor ID and product ID match between the information obtained during tape discovery and the information in the internal tape qualification table. If the storage system discovers a match, it marks the tape drive as qualified and can access the tape drive. If the storage system cannot find a match, the tape drive remains in the unqualified state and is not accessed.
