In the storage virtual machine (SVM)-scoped NDMP mode, you must generate a password for a specific user ID. The generated password is based on the actual login password for the NDMP user. If the actual login password changes, you must generate the NDMP-specific password again.

.Steps

. Use the `vserver services ndmp generate-password` command to generate an NDMP-specific password.
+
You can use this password in any current or future NDMP operation that requires password input.
+
[NOTE]
====
From the storage virtual machine (SVM, formerly known as Vserver) context, you can generate NDMP passwords for users belonging only to that SVM.
====
+
The following example shows how to generate an NDMP-specific password for a user ID user1:
+
----

cluster1::vserver services ndmp> generate-password -vserver vs1 -user user1

Vserver: vs1
User: user1
Password: jWZiNt57huPOoD8d
----

. If you change the password to your regular storage system account, repeat this procedure to obtain your new NDMP-specific password.
