Before you perform SMTape backup and restore operations in a MetroCluster configuration, you must understand how SMTape operations are affected when a switchover or switchback operation occurs.

== SMTape backup or restore operation followed by switchover

Consider two clusters: cluster 1 and cluster 2. During an SMTape backup or restore operation on cluster 1, if a switchover is initiated from cluster 1 to cluster 2, then the following occurs:

* If the value of the `–override-vetoes` option is `false`, then the switchover process is aborted and the backup or restore operation continues.
* If the value of the option is `true`, then the SMTape backup or restore operation is aborted and the switchover process continues.

== SMTape backup or restore operation followed by switchback

A switchover is performed from cluster 1 to cluster 2 and an SMTape backup or restore operation is initiated on cluster 2. The SMTape operation backs up or restores a volume that is located on cluster 2. At this point, if a switchback is initiated from cluster 2 to cluster 1, then the following occurs:

* If the value of the `–override-vetoes` option is `false`, then the switchback process is aborted and the backup or restore operation continues.
* If the value of the option is `true`, then the backup or restore operation is aborted and the switchback process continues.

== SMTape backup or restore operation initiated during a switchover or switchback

During a switchover process from cluster 1 to cluster 2, if an SMTape backup or restore operation is initiated on cluster 1, then the backup or restore operation fails and the switchover continues.

During a switchback process from cluster 2 to cluster 1, if an SMTape backup or restore operation is initiated from cluster 2, then the backup or restore operation fails and the switchback continues.
