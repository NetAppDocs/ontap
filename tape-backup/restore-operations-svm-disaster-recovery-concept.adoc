You can perform tape backup and restore operations simultaneously during disaster recovery in a MetroCluster configuration. You must understand how these operations are affected during disaster recovery.

If tape backup and restore operations are performed on a volume of anSVM in a disaster recovery relationship, then you can continue performing incremental tape backup and restore operations after a switchover and switchback.
