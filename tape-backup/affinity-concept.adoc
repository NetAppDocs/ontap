With the backup application being CAB aware, the NDMP server provides unique location information about volumes and tape devices. Using this affinity information, the backup application can perform a local backup instead of a three-way backup if a volume and a tape device share the same affinity.

If the NDMP control connection is established on a node management LIF, cluster management LIF, or an intercluster LIF, the backup application can use the affinity information to determine if a volume and tape device are located on the same node and then perform either a local or a three-way backup or restore operation. If the NDMP control connection is established on a data LIF, then the backup application always performs a three-way backup.

Using the affinity information about volumes and tape devices, the DMA (backup application) performs a local NDMP backup on the volume and tape device located on Node 1 in the cluster. If the volume moves from Node 1 to Node 2, affinity information about the volume and tape device changes. Hence, for a subsequent backup the DMA performs a three-way NDMP backup operation. This ensures continuity of the backup policy for the volume irrespective of the node to which the volume is moved to.
