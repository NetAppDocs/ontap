[.lead]
When the automatic data balancer (ADB) is enabled, the balancer analyzes the usage statistics of aggregates to identify the aggregate that has exceeded the configured high-threshold usage percentage.

After identifying the aggregate that has exceeded the threshold, the balancer identifies a volume that can be moved to aggregates residing in another node in the cluster and attempts to move that volume. This situation affects the backup policy configured for this volume because if the data management application (DMA) is not CAB aware, then the user has to reconfigure the backup policy and run the baseline backup operation.

[NOTE]
====
If the DMA is CAB aware and the backup policy has been configured using specific interface, then the ADB is not affected.
