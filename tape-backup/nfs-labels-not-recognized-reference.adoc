* *Message*
+
`Error: Aborting: dump encountered NFS security labels in the file system`

* *Cause*
+
NFS security labels are supported Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1 when NFSv4.2 is enabled. However, NFS security labels are not currently recognized by the dump engine. If it encounters any NFS security labels on the files, directories, or any special files in any format of dump, the dump fails.

* *Corrective action*
+
Verify that no files or directories have NFS security labels.
