You can add tape drives and libraries to storage system dynamically (without taking the storage system offline).

When you add a new medium changer, the storage system detects its presence and adds it to the configuration. If the medium changer is already referenced in the alias information, no new logical names are created. If the library is not referenced, the storage system creates a new alias for the medium changer.

In a tape library configuration, you must configure a tape drive or medium changer on LUN 0 of a target port for ONTAP to discover all medium changers and tape drives on that target port.
