[.lead]
SMTape operations cannot commence when a volume rehost operation is in progress on a volume. When a volume is involved in a volume rehost operation, SMTape sessions should not be started on that volume.

If any volume rehost operation is in progress, then SMTape backup or restore fails. If an SMTape backup or restore is in progress, then volume rehost operations fail with an appropriate error message. This condition applies to both NDMP-based and CLI-based backup or restore operations.
