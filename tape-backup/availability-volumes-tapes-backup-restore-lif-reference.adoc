You can configure a backup application to establish an NDMP control connection on any of the LIF types in a cluster. In the storage virtual machine (SVM)-scoped NDMP mode, you can determine the availability of volumes and tape devices for backup and restore operations depending upon these LIF types and the status of the CAB extension.

The following tables show the availability of volumes and tape devices for NDMP control connection LIF types and the status of the CAB extension:

== Availability of volumes and tape devices when CAB extension is not supported by the backup application

[options="header"]
|===
| NDMP control connection LIF type| Volumes available for backup or restore| Tape devices available for backup or restore
a|
Node-management LIF
a|
All volumes hosted by a node
a|
Tape devices connected to the node hosting the node-management LIF
a|
Data LIF
a|
Only volumes that belong to the SVM hosted by a node that hosts the data LIF
a|
None
a|
Cluster-management LIF
a|
All volumes hosted by a node that hosts the cluster-management LIF
a|
None
a|
Intercluster LIF
a|
All volumes hosted by a node that hosts the intercluster LIF
a|
Tape devices connected to the node hosting the intercluster LIF
