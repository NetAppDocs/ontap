[.lead]
You must be aware of the maximum number of dump backup and restore sessions that can be performed simultaneously on storage systems of different system memory capacities. This maximum number depends on the system memory of a storage system.

The limits mentioned in the following table are for the dump or restore engine. The limits mentioned in the scalability limits for NDMP sessions are for the NDMP server, which are higher than the engine limits.

|===
| System memory of a storage system| Total number of dump backup and restore sessions

Less than 16 GB
a|

a|
Greater than or equal to 16 GB but less than 24 GB

Greater than or equal to 24 GB

[NOTE]
====
If you use `ndmpcopy` command to copy data within storage systems, two NDMP sessions are established, one for dump backup and the other for dump restore.
====

You can obtain the system memory of your storage system by using the `sysconfig -a` command (available through the nodeshell). 
Learn more about `sysconfig -a` in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli/system-node-run.html[ONTAP command reference^].
