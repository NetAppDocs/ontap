Tape seeding is an SMTape functionality that helps you initialize a destination FlexVol volume in a data protection mirror relationship.

Tape seeding enables you to establish a data protection mirror relationship between a source system and a destination system over a low-bandwidth connection.

Incremental mirroring of Snapshot copies from the source to the destination is feasible over a low bandwidth connection. However, an initial mirroring of the base snapshot takes a long time over a low-bandwidth connection. In such cases, you can perform an SMTape backup of the source volume to a tape and use the tape to transfer the initial base snapshot to the destination. You can then set up incremental SnapMirror updates to the destination system using the low-bandwidth connection.
