When a SnapMirror destination volume or a SnapVault secondary volume changes state from read/write to read-only or from read-only to read/write, you must perform a baseline tape backup or restore operation.

SnapMirror destination and SnapVault secondary volumes are read-only volumes. If you perform tape backup and restore operations on such volumes, you must perform a baseline backup or restore operation whenever the volume changes state from read-only to read/write or from read/write to read-only.
